It s been 12 months since I first got in touch with this profession and many of my classes are in English. It felt uncomfortable when I heard how ""pi"" was pronounced in English, considering œÄ is a Greek letter and I usually know English pronunciations. Greetings from Thessaloniki! You helped me with your videos!    "

eIrMbAQSU34,SquidSnipes,3 months ago,Just to help some other people that might be confused at the ending of For-each where you try to reverse it. the fruits.length = 3 when you try to index 3 on the fruits array there s no index so just change the [i] inside the print statement to [i - 1]  
eIrMbAQSU34,Richard Rackley,2 years ago,"Mosh, thank you so much for giving an explanation for just about every word that you type, whether it be short and sweet to be elaborated upon at a later time, or an in depth explanation from the start. I get so tired of when teachers tell me to write a ton code only to say ""Don t worry about this line of code, I ll explain later"", or never explain it at all. It s so frustrating since the way I learn and conceptualize is by understanding why I m typing something.    "

eIrMbAQSU34,Hristina Stankovic,1 month ago (edited),"At the 2:10:49 - While loop, you made a mistake, the variable ""i"" should be initiated with 5 in order for the ""Hello World"" expression to be written 5 times (it will be written 5 times if the while condition is (i > 0)). This is the case in which we are decrementing ""i"". The same result can be achieved if we initiate ""i"" with 0 and put this condition in while loop: (i<5) and increment the ""i"". "

eIrMbAQSU34,Light Yagami,1 year ago (edited),"Thanks so much for this Mosh. I hope you don t mind me pointing out a bug in your reverse iterative for loop at 2:21:14. You ll get an index out of range (as length returns the cardinality of the array, but the index goes only up to length minus one since it starts from zero). Also, by using strictly greater than operator, you will stop short of the last item (first element of the array in reverse list). To fix, please change to for (int i = fruits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) followed by your print statement.    "

Hl-zzrqQoSE,cotter548,9 years ago,"PSA: If you do these steps and you are still getting the ""unrecognized"" error in the CMD prompt, then read this:  The way I fixed it is to add an environment variable called JAVA_HOME and point it at the base install directory for the version of Java that you installed (C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21). Next, create your PATH environment variable using the string %JAVA_HOME%\bin   "

Hl-zzrqQoSE,Ram Gopal,3 years ago,"Hi,   Going through your tutorials and it is really very good. But I have a question to ask. You asked us to add an environmental variable named path in properties of my computer.  I already had a variable named path and it was mapping to some address. I changed it with the address of the bin folder of the Java file in programming files. What change have I exactly made? How is this change gonna affect my system ?   "

Remember to close command prompt then reopen or it won t work! "
Hl-zzrqQoSE,Ali Alizadeh,5 years ago,Write a Java program called AdjustMarks that gets a set of test scores and uses the Marker class to calculate the mean with the lowest score dropped.  The program features include asking the user for the number of test scores; creating an array to hold the scores; creating a Marker object passing the scores array as a parameter; displaying the lowest score; adjusting the mean by annulling (dropping) the lowest score and displaying the adjusted mean.

Hl-zzrqQoSE,KfC,5 years ago,Here is some advice to fellow beginners:  I ve noticed that watching Bucky type the code wasn t that helpful but after everything was typed his explanation is short and concise. I just watch the beginning and the end of the videos and it s giving me a good idea of the logic behind what is being discussed (which in my opinion is  the most valuable for beginners like me).   
Hl-zzrqQoSE,Hhl Est,10 years ago,"Hi, first of all, you need to make sure you typed the correct path for ""javac"". if you did so, then, do the same thing for the system variables. It might be some sort of confidentiality issues. I hope this works. "

Hl-zzrqQoSE,Jared Geere,10 years ago,"I figured out why it may not work for some of you. You have to make sure you set the path, to the Java path in PROGRAM FILES. Not in PROGRAM FILES(X86). Program files is where the directory or path will look something like this : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10\bin If you set your path to something like this then jave WILL NOT COMPILE: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin  Hope that helped :)   "

Hl-zzrqQoSE,Milind Patil,8 years ago,I believe you can  also add the path into the PATH system environment variable directly. I followed the steps which are mentioned in video by creating new Path variable but did not worked (In Window 7). I added into the system varaible (PATH) and it worked for me. 
Hl-zzrqQoSE,onelife151,10 years ago,I understand this is a beginner tutorial but most windows systems already have a PATH variable defined. you can just add the link to the existing path variable.

Hl-zzrqQoSE,Afif Khaja,3 years ago,I was having an incompatibility error between java development kit (jdk) and java (jre)  when I tried to run the hello world! from my command prompt. Problem was that I had an older version of java (jre) installed so I had to go to add/remove programs and uninstall java (jre) while letting jdk remain installed. Note that jdk includes java (jre) but if you already have an older version of java (jre) installed then it causes problems

3u1fu6f8Hto,Atom Wolf,8 years ago,I m currently in College and our language is c# which is of course very similar to Java. I wanted to have a go at learning Java and while I know most of the content I must commend you on the simplicity in which you taught the loops and arrays. These are usually things people struggle with and I to struggled with when learning them for c#. Bravo :D

3u1fu6f8Hto,Devin Villarreal,9 years ago,"I remember him saying at one point in the video that when he was first learning Java he struggled with the concept of how objects worked and I believe this tutorial was inspired from his passion to help the beginner. The lesson plan introduces things a well-thought-out order and the exercises are relevant to real life situations where the Java language comes to use. This video has been edited to have maximum content and minimal down time. I must have re-watched sections of this video over 20 times for them to really sink in and the result was the feeling of being enlightened when things really started coming together. If I could go back, this video itself would have been my single starting point for Java. I highly recommend picking up the full version to support Patrick s contribution (and see the rest of the video. The 2 hour mark is my favorite part)    "
3u1fu6f8Hto,Jeff Mandeville,7 years ago,Absolutely brilliant! Your teaching methods are so easy to follow.

3u1fu6f8Hto,Amjad Mirza,7 years ago,I hated java as a uni student and just got through pass grades..uni days are now a distant memory for me and today I stumbled across this video..

I can tell you that there are two intangibles that no course will teach you that every developer should know: excellent communication and networking (as in making social connections). There‚Äôs lots of great code courses that will make you proficient. What will separate you is your communication and your reputation (networking).  "
79pKwdiqcwI,jamie mcmanaman,5 months ago,I like how you are straight to the point and backing your arguements with guiding through some sites and telling people how to do achieve things.

79pKwdiqcwI,Tigerio Movies,4 months ago,Hey! Just watched your video.  I had a view in my mind that C++ and Java are the languages that give more control over to the programmer for example working with data types and stuff and that becomes a reason why companies are looking for people to prepare for interviews in the mentioned languages.

If correct it continues, if I answer wrong I have to stsrt over. It s been a ton of fun but I will definitely be taking these steps into account! I love the way you laid it out so clearly and easily, especially for people like me who can t just drop a bunch of money on courses or can t afford to stop work to go to school. Thank you!    "

79pKwdiqcwI,jamie robb,7 months ago (edited),Tutorials are fine. The key take away is to build your own project on the side while doing it and implementing the features the tutorial teaches as you go along in your own. That solidifies the logic and code as you have to think about the concepts in new ways to fit your project.

79pKwdiqcwI,James Whitlock,8 months ago,"This video came out on my birthday, so I am gonna take it as a sign it was meant for me to see. I decided to start coding and as of writing this comment I am only 4 days in. I decided to take a udemy course and one of the courses you show in this video is the course I am taking. One thing about the courses is that you can get them done quite fast if you just do the assignments in them and nothing else. I am not doing that. Any new concept that is taught in the course I find myself just playing around with the code for hours making little programs and scripts so I can get used to using the new concepts. From what it sounds like in your video the source of the education for something like python might not necessarily be the issue, it s what you do with what you learn that matters. Sure a few people could probably learn just from watching endless videos and not coding, but most people probably need to code while learning so they can actually immerse their brains into the code to learn. That s what my hope is and so far I feel like it s working for me pretty well.    "

79pKwdiqcwI,Corv,7 months ago,"Great info in this video. Awesome that you didn t try to sell us anything. I will say, I don t entirely agree with your point about courses, as long as you choose one that requires you to actually write a substantial amount of code yourself. There is a fantastic python Udemy course I took that I have found really good so far (I won t say which one, don t wanna spam your channel). It is far from merely watching someone else code like you mentioned; it provides really difficult hands-on challenges that result in some pretty cool projects. It s supposed to take around 3 months to do, and after only about 30 days of going through it so far (and a little bit of skipping a few things), I ve already written a few games (command line games lol) and a few small practical apps with tkinter guis. More importantly, I actually completely understand everything I ve done so far; every single concept, even though it s fairly beginner-intermediate.    "

79pKwdiqcwI,Will Patterson,10 months ago (edited),"Wow! Great video:) I think the biggest question I‚Äôve been facing on my journey is how on earth do people with no experience actually get interviews with Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Is it really as simple as just becoming proficient with Python, creating some projects, and then contacting recruiters? I am just surprised that someone would be able to land interviews with a few arbitrary projects like a spam filter or a trading algorithm. Wouldn‚Äôt web development companies like Google be more likely to interview you if you‚Äôve built a simple CRUD website (which would require fundamental knowledge of web development more than just basic Python), or if you have some sort of expertise in front end, back end, or mobile? Or are these companies more impressed with unique, insightful, and clever projects that really stand out amongst the crowd? If the latter is true, then I could see why it would only take 6 months to get an interview at Amazon, FB, or Google. All you would have to do is get really good at Python, and then just create really cool and unique projects. If so, then that‚Äôs really encouraging!!    "

Another thing that actually helped me is to being greedy with my projects, I mean, trying to do something that requires more knowelge from what i had, so that pushed me to search for new topics and learn new things faster.

My lack of proficiency in DSA. I can think up a good portion of problems, but have trouble coding it. I have been hard headed in learning it in Java or Kotlin, but there s no good comprehensive resources for those languages. Plus, some of the setup (especially with Java) is a bit much. This time, I ll take the advice and learn Python for DSA. Udacity helped me a ton last year, I believe it can do it again. I ll update this comment and tell y all how it went.   "

I feel like this is a puzzle, and what I am doing is grabbing every piece, even if it is a big piece, and trying to fit it into a small space, without actually understanding and strategically thinking about the different sized pieces. I m just throwing random code at problems and hoping to see if it works, getting stuck for 30 minutes on beginner problems, and then looking at the solution and wondering how the hell I was supposed to get the answer. It is not straightforward in any way shape or form and does not follow a pattern. This makes me not want to keep going, because, at the end of the day, if I can not figure out how to create two lists that contain 10 instances of two different variables, and then create a list that combines the two variables 10 times each in 1 hour, with all of the ""course material"" in front of me, how am I supposed to ever understand what I am actually doing in the language? Let alone learn python? Or even get a job?   "

WPvGqX-TXP0,CookieNKreme,5 years ago,"This is wonderful!  I usually get quite bored hearing the basics over and over again, pacing was PERFECT and fast, easy to grasp if you are familiar with the concepts already.  Thank you! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Buffalo,4 years ago,"Im a complete beginner to Java and this is way too fast for learning, BUT I find it very useful to have heard everything before I actually learn it so it feels familiar when actually taking my time. So this is perfect for that if you don t know any Java already. So thanks a lot Derek, great video and nice speed walkthrough of what to expect :) "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Snow Chan,3 years ago,"I ve been learning C for about a week now. Obviously I don t get everything, but I found this video very fun to watch. You explain arrays really well. "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Robageddon,5 years ago,"Great brush-up coarse! Wouldn t recommend for beginners to programming, but if you understand any other OO Language this is great for syntax. I took Java 3 years ago for one semester, forgot everything and this course helped a ton! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Ayyzuk,5 years ago,"learned Pascal in school, watched this 30-minute video in an hour and a half and now I pretty much know Java as well as Pascal (despite some specific functions such as qsort or Floyd s algorythm). Really helpful! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Paul,6 years ago,I actually really enjoyed this. It was probably too fast for someone who has never seen the language before but I already have a grasp of the fundamentals of Java so this was very refreshing to watch  
WPvGqX-TXP0,mintyfresh,5 years ago,"If you have zero coding/ Java experience, this is might not be the place to start. As someone who is taking an intro Java class this incredibly helpful/ useful. You made finals much easier. Thank you kind sir.  "

WPvGqX-TXP0,Hansul Hudson Jr,5 years ago,"WOW! I am stunned at how easily I was able to follow along with this tutorial. I am currently studying for a A.S. Degree in Programming & Analysis and am a couple of courses away from finishing. This is almost the same as all the other languages like C++, C#, and Objective C with some differences. I now see the whole big picture when many say despite the various types of programming, all programming languages use the same basic concepts. I m thinking of going the Java route. I want to personally thank Derek Banas for providing this in depth tutorial on the Java Programming Language.   "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Stephen Smith,4 years ago,"Just passed my oracle certified associate exam :) I learned so much from your videos so just wanted to say thanks. Your tip,  ""think like a compiler"" really helped when the questions got tough. Once again THANK YOU DEREK !!! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Oscar Monroy,4 years ago,"One day i started hearing about coding, and how there was a  demand for coders. I had previously taken a cis101 course, so i decided to enroll in a programming logic course, and then a java syntax course. This video is the java syntax, its a quick run thru of the java syntax. The textbook "" how to program in java"" will explain how to use the syntax in this video to build a program. It is very helpful to enroll in a college course to have a teacher guide you thru the process of learning how to program. It is a process, you cannot jump to a 30 minute snap shot of the syntax and expect to comprehend.  Do not get discouraged, if  you are willing to invest the time and effort to understand java syntax, it will eventually begin to sink in. So far I have invested 2 years in computer information science, and it has been very rewarding. Do not pay for a boot camp until you have invested and completed  in at least 3-4 college level courses.    "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Peter Chad Henniker,5 years ago,"These tutorials are really cool for revisiting concepts, when you are a beginner. Really helpful. "

WPvGqX-TXP0,Stephane Wheeler,3 years ago,"I really like the speed of this tutorial. I know most tuts out there are designed for people with 0 experience... and those are frustrating to people that have experience and want a crash course. I think this is well done in a timely manner, and he also touches on a few key points that beginners should know along the way! Thanks man! I think I may be ready for this interview now! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,4bits,3 years ago,Great video. It s a great way to overview everything you re currently learning. I understood everything up to 17 minutes because I m still in the process of learning java. I also took notes on the definitions for everything because you ve explained it well. Thanks bro! 
WPvGqX-TXP0,Ambre Soubiran,5 years ago,"This is a really great tutorial! Took be about 3h to complete as I kept pausing and coding it in Eclipse at the same time, but it s really good and clear, I ve learnt Java about 10 years ago at school and I m trying to get back to it. Thanks Derek! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Hipster Pup,3 years ago,"Hey Derek, I just wanted to say THANK YOU for all the work you ve put into making your programming tutorial videos.

WPvGqX-TXP0,Philipp,5 years ago,a sequel to this video would rock... just some more techniques like implementing Singleton etc. Also visibility and therefore Overloading etc. would be nice to watch again in a video that explains it quick.  Nice video! 
WPvGqX-TXP0,MoeHaider,5 years ago,It s refreshing hearing a tutorial from someone who s good at their verbal language not just the coding one ;D 
WPvGqX-TXP0,Wei Ming,5 years ago (edited),"He is making a program which incorporates every single lesson that you will be taught in your Java course.  The difference between the way he teaches and the way your professors teach is, your professor will be teaching everything in order while Derek combines all the knowledge you need into one mix.  He first talks about objects, classes, primitive types and simple things, but he suddenly jumps into getter and setter methods along with parent and child classes which are usually taught during the 2nd year.     "
WPvGqX-TXP0,John Dupper,4 years ago,"Derek, you are the man. Thank you for taking the time to put these videos together, they re great! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Stuart McColl,6 years ago,Thanks Derek !  Format is unbelievable ... language and description very clear ... and you re even sliding in a few subtle jokes ... entertaining.  I m going to watch it 10 to 20 times until I get every single thing.  
WPvGqX-TXP0,louist103,6 years ago,I learned more in this video than I have so far in AP CS. So far we have gone up to chapter 6 in absolute Java(arrays). From August  to February. 
WPvGqX-TXP0,Donna Perygin,5 years ago,"Thanks! It s been a few years since I studied the java trail and wanted a quick refresher. I just jotted a few notes as I went along for things I need to look up later, but I understood about 95% of that. "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Amanda Thompson,4 years ago,Watching this to supplement my class and this is SUCH a great explanation of the syntax. Great overview even for beginners. 
WPvGqX-TXP0,stay woke,6 years ago,This is great for people who already know some of the language. I m sure that other people would be lost only 5 minutes in... Great video!  
WPvGqX-TXP0,Ren Gaming,4 years ago,After spending over a year in school taking an AP course in this... This video finally made complete sense... Now to find out how to perfectly pseudocode before a program and how to use the syntax data base to program anything I can think of :)

WPvGqX-TXP0,Grzegorz Koziczak,2 years ago,"04:53 - ""src"" is just a folder, not a java package. You are working inside ""default package"" and this is the range of protected attribute.  "
WPvGqX-TXP0,spectre42,7 years ago,"It is a very great tutorial for someone who already knows a similar programming language. I know a bit of c# and it was cool to see in 30 mins what basic java looks like. But, of course, for total beginners this video might be a bit too fast)))  "
WPvGqX-TXP0,TyTelevised,3 years ago,"Thanks for the upload, I‚Äôm in my 2nd semester of CS and was questioning if I really know the core programming knowledge. After watching I realized, I know how to do everything in this video and I have more confidence now. Thanks  "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Falcon3,5 years ago,"@14:15 ""Dont try to memorize this if your new.. but I doubt new people hung around for this..""  haha, you knew who you had in mind when making it, and its really really well presented, Nice work, hadn t touched java in ages, got me back up to speed in 30 minutes. Many thanks good sir. "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Marc Maguire,4 years ago,I m an iOS developer who is going to pick up some Java tasks in the coming weeks at work. I cannot believe how similar the syntax is for so many parts of Java and Swift. This video was a perfect way to figure out the syntax - I ll google everything else on an as needed basis. 
WPvGqX-TXP0,Andrew Aliela,3 years ago,"So I came here after watching ""Learn Java Programming in 15 Minutes!"" by DevFactor and I have to say, the Java programming language is really coming together for me. The content here is solid, well delivered and well explained although I had to pause every couple of minutes to take everything in. My advice to anyone watching this is to write the code as he writes it and modify it as you go to represent more realistic and complex world scenarios.   "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Akshay Chilad,1 year ago,After 2 years of gap I wanted to memorize java and your video helped me to recall most of it in the span of 18 minutes (2X Speed)

WPvGqX-TXP0,Marshall,5 years ago,Great tutorial! I know python so I was not totally lost and thought this was a great basic leason:) 
WPvGqX-TXP0,Arthur Kettelhut,5 years ago,"An excellent tutorial.  Audience should have some fundamental knowledge of data types, or the difference between a string and in integer.  The line by line narration is exactly what I like to see.  Finally, watch as many times as it takes, you don t have to grasp everything on the first pass. "
WPvGqX-TXP0,vmexplorer,4 years ago,"Awesome job on this video thank you for posting it.  I used this to help as a refresher as I took JAVA Intro about a year ago, and am now taking JAVA advanced.  This is just what I needed to kickstart me into the advanced class! "

WPvGqX-TXP0,MindMeme,8 years ago,I really like how all the basics were quickly ran through with great edits. This is like the first 3 or 4 chapters of lots of books in 30 minutes! I hope you do more advanced videos as I want to learn what one does with all this information after one learns it.    
WPvGqX-TXP0,naveen karthick,5 years ago,Thank you so much i have always been looking for a video that brushes up just the syntax and how object-oriented programming is in java This helped me a lot :)

WPvGqX-TXP0,Vincent Perrier,4 years ago,"Hey great video ! Awesome job on teaching the syntax quickly and to the point ! Quick question, at 11:40 you show how to make getters and setters for public access variables in eclipse.  If you are not using any verification on those, why not just declare the variable public and leave it there ? I m asking this because if the variable is public, the client can just bypass the getter and setter and modify it directly: and then it just seem like writing useless code. Is this actually a thing you need to do for public access variables in java? I m coming from a C/C++ background, maybe java is just that different ! :)   "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Sumita Parte,4 years ago (edited),Great video for revision! Would appreciate if you post more java topics like this 
WPvGqX-TXP0,ViaVanille,6 years ago (edited),"Thank you so much for this video. I am used to C++, but I switched schools where their classes are in Java and I now have to learn Java syntax, which in my opinion you did great on explaining! Thanks again!  "

WPvGqX-TXP0,Saraswathi Shanmugamoorthy,5 years ago,"awesome just what I needed. I already know c++, so I could skip the basic details like intro to data types, loops etc and just dive into the java part. Thanks for the awesome work Derek. "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Paul,5 years ago,"I have helped code a room in a MUD game so I slightly understood what was happening 50% of the time.  I wish you had explained what void was earlier.  I also think that someone completely new could understand this after rewatching it a few times, as I plan on doing, if you explained a little more when and what you were telling the computer you were defining and the desired result.  Essentially you were explaining the strokes of your brush and waiting for the new coders in your audience to figure out what your were painting.  If you did this you could have made a followup video explaining types of situations these functions are used for beyond making the computer act like an animal that does math.  This would make a great refresher obviously, but as your title is not ""a refresher of core java functions"" I believe a new version that takes an hour and fleshes it out a bit would actually be helpful to new people and get less angry or confused posts.

WPvGqX-TXP0,Brandon Chapman,4 years ago,"Well I ve improved quite a bit. I watched a video you did in another language a year ago when first starting to learn programming. WAY too fast for a newbie. If you already know a language your pace is great for bright minds. Now exactly a year and 3 days into the grind, watching your videos is not an issue and I feel less inferior lol. Thanks for the vid! "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Daniel H,4 years ago (edited),"This is an excellent Java primer for anybody who is already experienced in programming.  To anybody wholly new to programming: THIS TUTORIAL IS NOT FOR YOU. Most of this code is just nonsense and contains bad practices, but it is a useful showcase of the core language structure and features, if you are already experienced. So don t be disheartened. Go buy a programming book, switch your internet off, and start playing around.    "

WPvGqX-TXP0,Zach T,5 years ago,"Yes he goes very fast, and will not lessen the speed at which he teaches in fear of someone missing out. This is great, because you force yourself to recgonize different things you wouldnt have, it trains your mind to quickly recgonize something and not overthink it. Sure I may not be able to code % .000021 of what hes coding, but now I can actually contribute to a convo about java coding. "

This information you provided is going to actualize the real worlds end of semester project that is about a third of class points,.....  I am going to post you as a resource for the class and suggest my instrutor do the same as he failed to provide even the basic explanation of how to transform the logic into Java.   "

But yeah, since almost 80% of it does not do anything with animals, no  logic helps to remember to the previous function), it would have been difficult to follow without the sourcefile (this video takes only 30 minutes just because he speaks fast, and we can t see what function we are reffering which was made only 1 minute ago).

WPvGqX-TXP0,Ricky Lahey,5 years ago (edited),if you know c++ and/or vb.net then you pretty much have the generals about how it works and new languages offer benefits over the old ones. you should mention a few basic advantages and disadvantage of java that define it as a language.  for example can you allocate memory? i m pretty sure we can also connect to a database in java? nice tutorial however it was great but i m thirsty for more

WPvGqX-TXP0,Faiaz A,3 years ago,I have a java lab where I have a class called BlackJackGame which calls method from 2 other classes so the methods are overlapping one another. The cardPile class contains basic instance variables and methods the card class has array lists which uses the cardpile class to write methods to verify whether card is faceUp or how many turns a player gets and other conditions. The Black Jack Game class uses methods overlapping the 2 classes to produce executable program.

For some of the beginners complaining, first of all, the title doesn t say ""Java Programming for beginners"" so I don t know why you guys are so upset and expecting to learn everything in detail on a 30-minute video anyway. If you are absolute beginner, there s a more in-depth version in the description.  "
WPvGqX-TXP0,Zombified Apple,4 years ago,"I m new to coding. I would love to learn how to code. Unfortunately I was confused with much of the video. I watched the whole thing. Paying as much attention as I could. At least I understand a little bit more on what I will be facing. Makes me excited to actually learn the language. If anybody else has any more information and practicing tips, or maybe even a website I could go practice or inform myself with. Please let me know. "

WPvGqX-TXP0,nicbongo,5 years ago,"Hey again Derek, found your videos again! I got thinking though, the noob I am, for me it would be useful to start with a final product, and then reverse engineer it. That way you can see what a bit of code does in relation to the final product. I find it hard to keep track of all these terms, variables and what they re leading too. Just some feedback, I humbly accept I ve got not idea how to one would go abouts doing it and how difficult that may be. Either way, as always, I m grateful for you sharing your knowledge. Best!   "

WPvGqX-TXP0,Stan M,6 years ago,This is great. Whenever I go to look at courses I know first half will be totally useless aside from seeing minute differences in context between languages. This basically condensed the basics for people that already have majority of programming concepts (just not specifically in java).    
WPvGqX-TXP0,serrendipity,2 years ago,"Other than talking like a buzz saw, your method of teaching is better than most (though not perfect). Pretty much everywhere I ve looked, the training vids spend ages going through all the language of Java in the expectation that you re going to soak it up and then start programming. It is far better (IMHO) to have a definite and perhaps more useful programme that the student can follow along with and learn each component of Java as it is used. A lot of what s being taught (by many trainers) is stuff that you d go to a reference source for anyway (such as data types), so why go to great lengths to explain them while the student nods off to sleep..

WPvGqX-TXP0,Fraser Paine,6 years ago,"All the people saying this didn t immediately make them understand Java. That s not the point.

8cm1x4bC610,Anish Yadav,3 years ago,Hello Navin @Telusko You mentioned that Java doesn t support Multiple Inheritance because of the problem of ambiguity but that reason is incorrect as C++ had already solved this problem before the inception of Java. The reason that Java doesn t support Multiple Inheritance is the developers of Java did not want to offer the full package and that is why they decided to implement Multiple Inheritance through interface. Kindly correct it.
