rfscVS0vtbw,@betadelphini4036,5 months ago (edited),"4 years ago I randomly searched for a programming tutorial to get in to software industry, landed on this tutorial by Mike, loved his teachings immediately, and that s how I got in to Python Programming, I am now a Lead Software Engineer developing Python applications at a Tier-1 IT services company!  "

rfscVS0vtbw,@adamakaba2267,4 months ago,"So, I just finished this course in about 2 full days with notes with step by step pausing each time. It is very time consuming, but compared to paying for classes/courses (which I have already done) this has to be one of the best free courses as it teaches you many basics that you can implement into more complex problems. I am very grateful to be alive in era where we can experience quality teaching with no cost. Thank you so much!!  "

rfscVS0vtbw,@BasedBozo,3 months ago,Thank you sir. As a 14 year old I m surprised how easy and fun this course is to understand.

rfscVS0vtbw,@stanpriebe7672,2 years ago,"Several weeks ago I commented that I was a few days away from turning 73 and I was learning Python.  I was overwhelmed at the likes and replies given my post.  Thank you all so much.  Some even replied with a  birthday wishes  Python program.  I have tried many times to like all the replies, but as I continue to click  Review replies , YouTube eventually reloads.  I apologize that I cannot like every reply.  A few asked why I was learning Python at my age.  I m still working full time, and I believe new skills are always good.  Others asked how my learning was goin.  I watch some of the video, then practice to determine how much I have learned then watch more and practice. My goal is Python certification.  Again, thank you all for your support.   27K "

I do my best to try to incorporate the previous lessons into the following ones (for repetition) even if its redundant. for example: in the Dictionary lesson I called a user input then used if/elif to compare the variable to the month code and printed based off that. Way more work, but good practice combining things.  "

Obviously we are using python for this and I must say watching this video ahead of time has put me miles ahead of my classmates and I can easily finish my homework within an hour and watching a 4 hour video has taught me more than my college has taught me in a 4 month semester.

There are two ways to fix this. The easiest way is  to uninstall python and reinstall it and check that box. The other way involves manually setting your python script folder s filepath to your PC s %PATH% in command prompt. Google for instructions if you re adventurous. P.S. - The pip module he demonstrates for you to install (python docx) doesn t work anymore. It throws a legacy error and appears to be out of date (ver. 0.8.11)    "

I know exactly how I want things to be, and I have so much prior knowledge. The thing is, ... the software I want to make has so much advanced features that I am starting to fear that this language might not be able to run my software to be as fast and not laggy as I want. I m afraid that there are limits I am not aware of at the moment. And what I mean by advance; is that the software runs a crazy number of operations simultaneously. I want to know whether or not I am taking the right steps. Because I am extremely new to coding, and I have no source of guidance, specially that my project is EXTREMELY BEYOND specific.   "

May I ask why we cannot just add a Print(num*num*num*) instead and use cube(3) instead of print(cube(3))? Is it because we want to break out of the function we created using return? Or is it just another way of approaching it? Also, the parameter we are entering; since we aren t defining a variable for num, does it just take the same status as the value entered when calling the function? For example, since we are entering an integer in the call, the ""num"" parameter in the def function takes an integer form?    "

Same with student and chef). I had to label everything differently so I could follow my code easier but in doing so it made following the video a little harder since I had to make a mental note of all the connections myself.

I found your 1 hour course quite helpful with referencing the basic principles of computing languages, and the key terms of how to use in in practice.

I majored in Mathematics in the undergrad and Computer Science (programming course, only C++ was taught) was my most dreaded subject. Sure enough, I got the lowest possible passing grade at the end of the sem. That was the only computer course in the BS Math curriculum.

So,  I am curious if there is a way to do this in either Emacs, or some other code editing software. I m just using Emacs because it was the first I tried out. I ve been copy pasting things to GoogleDocs and just putting notes by it in a different text color, as I learn, but I find this time consuming. Very very noobie question, so pardon my ignorance. Just kinda curious how people deal with this kind of thing.   "

wDIQ17T3sRk,Mirzac Andrei,3 years ago (edited),"Great effort to Tim! Love the fact he is using the UML diagram to get the overall project idea.   Just want to add on the value of testing, for those who are just starting make sure you get into the practice of testing your code either unit testing or go TDD this will save you a tone of time on debugging issues. At the beginning of the project, you always start very fast but once the projects get complex the time spent on trying to change or fix a bug is huge. That s why you need those tests to validate early and often that you are on the right path. Our minds aren t supposed to hold all those complex scenarios in our head at the same time, so make sure you test your intentions, also it will force you to think how to abstract and separate your responsibilities basically making your code cleaner.

The sending side also shouldn t need to worry about receiving the drawn board at that point, as that can cause potential issues. It would be sufficient to know whether or not the board was successfully received so the client knows whether it can toss the previous state or not, or if it should re-send it.    "

kqtD5dpn9C8,Bhat Umar,2 months ago (edited),27:00 is where the BODMAS gets applied. Since we are adding brackets to expression which then automatically makes brackets precedent.

Subscribed as hell!  "

I ll update this comment once I get my results to see if it made a difference - might mean I pass a module I m currently failing (it s not just python, we had excel but I missed the exam due to grief.)

kqtD5dpn9C8,itsGuy,2 months ago,"Thanks for the video, helps a lot. One thing I need to say, I find it confusing when you type stuff and then delete it and fill in other stuff, example 13:25 you type the int(birth_year) and then remove it and add into line 3, and make it line 2. It just loses people that type along with the lesson, other than that, great video and thanks again.  "

kqtD5dpn9C8,binface9,2 months ago,Awesome tutorial!   Concerning If Statements (34:30): I found that the code still ran correctly if I used a second  if  operator for a second  if block  instead of using elif.  In this case  elif  is redundant. Are there conditions that would cause the code to crash when using  if  where you should be using  elif ?

kqtD5dpn9C8,Gary Weliver,3 weeks ago,"Mosh, I finally realized to use the # hashtag the lines vs deleting so I can refer back to differences along the way. You try something with a result, then delete current example but when you delete the change to show the difference, it is gone forever. the # hashtag lets me save the lesson so I can  go back and try removing different hashtags and see the difference(s). I numbered all my new projects pythonProject1,  pythonProject2 etc. and named the files to match what is being taught , i.e. Variables,  Receiving Input, etc. I got a little lost in the PyCharm program itself since I had never used it before, it was hard for me to save lessons and then retrieve them.    "
kqtD5dpn9C8,binface9,2 months ago,"In the second exercise I used the or operator to accept both uppercase and lowercase characters and the else logic operator to print an error message if you type in anything other than k or l.  I used the elif operator for the second logic block (elif measure == ""K"" or measure == ""k"".  I converted to float in each of the logic blocks, rather than at the beginning. I realise that would slow down the code, but I m coding on an OG Raspberry Pi model B so it s slow anyway    "
kqtD5dpn9C8,Rogyx22,1 month ago (edited),"15:00 He didn t show it in the video*, but his program will write the answer as a float even if the inputs are integers! For example 10+20 will give you *30.0*. To get it to write *30 as an answer, you need to write it as this    "

Z1Yd7upQsXY,Nilanjan Bhattacharyya,1 year ago,Your explanation is awesome. But there is probably a fault in the code in the last chapter (swapping values of variables) 22:16 - you put temp1 & temp2 variables values to v1 and v2 respectively. But that s doesn t swap v1 and v2  s values. Rather you have to do temp1 = v2 and temp2 = v1. Please Remark my Comment.

With what I‚Äôve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Big thanks to shadeck Hatzakis..

Here‚Äôs a question about the while loop at 3:04:01 - if the while condition is tested multiple times (7 in this example), would it better to store the value from the call to the len() function for the string into a variable and use that in the while test, instead of the using the len() function itself? Seems like this could be significant if the string were very large.  "

8DvywoWv6fI,@MichaelHouston1982,1 year ago,"The point about this video is that he s actually teaching. Most online coding tutorials just get you do copy really complex projects monkey-see, monkey-do style, and the result is that you end up in Tutorial Hell, where you understand most of the stuff when it s being done by the tutor but you re absolutely incapable of applying it independently.

I have subscribed to many different courses and none of them opened the eye like you did. I think it s because you were straight ahead from the beginning with the explanation of the CPU and the Memory. Honestly, I believe that power point presentation of the code with graphic explanation like you did is far better than the actual video of a code running, and, us as ""students"" try to follow with the Instructor. Thank you for all this hard work you put in sharing Python knowledge with us. People like you make studying FUN and interesting. I am now at Chapter 7 and it s going just as you said in the beginning. Thank you.    "

Topic is more on data analytics(""maybe because python is primarily used on that part"") but as a beginner i just expected that somewhat a computer program like creating a program that shows a window that user input and data visualization may be made. But nevertheless, Topics are great with websites crawlers, json, sql and such.

From this point forward, (6:38:56) Networked Programs - Write a Web Browser, i just cannot keep up. I ve kept going and the XML and JSON lesson were easier for me than the html, http and cleansoup parts, but i still consider that I m not keeping up. I hope i will get back on track and this will start making sense to me when i reach the Python Objects chapter.   "
