3,"The Canadian Classification of Functions of Government (CCOFOG) presented excludes the acquisitions of non-financial assets and consumption of fixed capital expense. At this time, the nonfinancial estimates are not available as the integration work with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (CSMA) is in progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Consolidation is a method of presenting statistics for a set of units as if they constituted a single unit. In this table, the data is presented for consolidated governments. Consolidation involves the elimination of all transactions and debtor-creditor relationships that occur among the units being consolidated. In other words, a transaction of one unit is paired with the same transaction as recorded for the second unit and both transactions are eliminated. For example, if one provincial and territorial government unit owns a bond issued by a second provincial and territorial government unit located in a different province and data for the two units are being consolidated, then the stocks of bonds held as assets and liabilities are reported as if the bond did not exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Provincial-territorial and local governments data can be compared across provinces and territories because consolidation takes into account differences in administrative structure and government service delivery by removing the effects of internal public sector transactions within each jurisdiction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,"The Canadian Classification of Functions of Government (CCOFOG) is a detailed classification of the functions, or socioeconomic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through various kinds of outlays. Therefore, by definition, Government Business Enterprises (GBE's) are excluded from this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
