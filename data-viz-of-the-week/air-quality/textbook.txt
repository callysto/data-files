Chemical Bonding
“Chemistry is a field of science that quickly embraces
new technologies, so it was a natural area to capture
my attention. I have always been fascinated by new,
high-tech equipment. In my work, studying reactions, 
I get to use two remarkable devices: two ultrafast
pulsed lasers that fill two laboratories. They produce
very powerful bursts of light that last for time periods
as short as 100 fs. (A femtosecond, 10–15 s, is an
extremely short period of time. There are more 
femtoseconds in one second than there have been
days since the beginning of the universe!) We use

these lasers to study reactions in
which bonds form and break very
quickly. We are trying to learn how
these reactions work. We do this
fundamental research because it is
challenging and exciting, and
because when scientists and tech-
nologists understand more about
chemical processes, we will be
able to design cleaner and more
efficient processes for industry,
which will benefit every aspect of
our lives.”

The Nature of Matter
It is possible to argue that chemistry has been responsible for some of the haz-
ards of modern life. We are, after all, seeing environmental damage resulting
from resource extraction, we are discovering the toxic effects of some products,
and we are experiencing increasing difficulty disposing of our garbage, most of
which is artificially produced, thanks to chemistry. However, to argue that way
would be to ignore the underlying truth: Chemistry has been fundamental to the
development of society as we know it. We now have cleaner fuel, more durable
and safer paints, easy-care clothing, inexpensive fertilizers, life-saving pharma-
ceuticals, corrosion-resistant tools and machinery, and unusual new materials
that we are using in interesting new ways (Figure 1). All of this innovation has
made our lives better to some degree.

Chemistry is just another way to say “the understanding of the nature of
matter.” In order to further their understanding, chemists through the ages have
relied upon scientific inquiry, carrying out investigations and making careful
observations. The periodic table is an elegant way of summing up many of those
investigations and our knowledge about matter and its constituents, the ele-
ments. The observations that went into the creation of the periodic table also
helped to create the modern atomic theory. In turn, we can explain many of the
patterns in the properties of the elements in terms of atomic theory. In this
chapter, we will discuss the patterns used to classify the elements, and consider
how these patterns are explained by atomic theory.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• identify chemical substances and
reactions in everyday use or of
environmental significance;

• define atomic number, mass
number, and atomic mass, and
explain how these concepts relate
to isotopes and radioisotopes;

• demonstrate an understanding of
the periodic law, and describe
how electron arrangements and
forces in atoms can explain
trends in the periodic table;

• compare and explain the reac-
tivity of a series of elements, and
relate this reactivity to their posi-
tion in the periodic table; 

• construct, analyze, and interpret
graphs of properties that display
trends within the periodic table.

stituents of an atom, and how are they arranged? According to this
model, how do the atoms of the various elements differ from each
other?

(b) Based on your model of the atom, explain the organization of the ele-
ments in the periodic table.

2. What patterns in properties are you aware of among the elements of the
periodic table? Suggest some explanations for these patterns, using your
model of the atom.

3. (a) In what ways has the periodic table been useful to you in previous
chemistry courses?

ences between this table and the ones you used in previous grades.
Speculate about how these differences might help you in this course.

food, but a similarly sized and coloured rock is not. A cup of milk
is liquid; a cup of flour is not. Making observations and classi-
fying them are often the first steps toward forming an explana-

1.1 Elements and the Periodic Table
Long before recorded history, humans used elements for many purposes. Copper,
silver, and gold were put to many uses, both decorative and practical, in China and
western Asia. At the dawn of recorded history, ancient peoples discovered that
another element, tin, could be combined with copper to make a much harder
material (bronze) from which they made stronger cutting tools, more effective
weapons, and mirrors (Figure 1). About 2500 B.C., residents of what is now
Turkey learned to extract iron from iron ore. The Egyptians used cobalt to make
blue glass and antimony in cosmetics. In the first few centuries A.D., the Romans
discovered how to use lead to make water pipes and eating utensils.

Many modern scientists study elements in great detail. As a result, we have
developed thousands of new uses for elements and theories to explain their prop-
erties. We even have technologies that can create images of the atoms that make
up elements. Elements are pure substances that cannot be broken down into sim-
pler substances by chemical means. However, elements can be chemically com-
bined to form more complex pure substances known as compounds.

The majority of the known elements are metals. All metals except mercury
are solids at SATP (standard ambient temperature and pressure), which is
defined as exactly 25°C and 100 kPa. When you work with gases in Chapter 9,
you will find that there is another set of standard conditions, STP (standard tem-
perature and pressure), which is exactly 0°C and 101.325 kPa.

From many observations of the properties of elements, scientists have devel-
oped an empirical definition for metals: They are malleable, ductile, and con-
ductors of electricity. Metals are also described as lustrous, or shiny. You may be
very familiar with some metals (e.g., iron, copper, calcium) but less so with
others (e.g., vanadium, rhodium, osmium).

The remaining known elements are mostly nonmetals. Nonmetals are gen-
erally nonconductors of electricity in their solid form. At SATP, the nonmetals
are mostly gases or solids (Figure 2). Solid nonmetals are brittle and lack the
lustre of metals. Some of the more familiar nonmetals include oxygen, chlorine,
sulfur, and neon.

Some elements clearly do not fit the empirical definition for either metals or
nonmetals. These elements are members of a small class known as metalloids.
These elements are found near the blue “staircase line” that divides metals from
nonmetals on the periodic table (Figure 3). Boron, silicon, and antimony are all
metalloids.

Naming Elements

As there are over 100 known elements; memorizing all of their names is a formi-
dable task. Communicating across language barriers can be even more daunting.
This issue was addressed by Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848)
in the early 19th century. In 1814, he suggested using a code of letters as symbols
for elements. In this system, which is still used today, the symbol for each element
consists of either a single uppercase letter or an uppercase letter followed by a
lowercase letter. Because Latin was a common language of communication in
Berzelius’s day, many of the symbols were derived from the Latin names for the
elements (Table 1). Today, although the names of elements are different in dif-
ferent languages, the same symbols are used in all languages. Scientific commu-
nication throughout the world depends on this language of symbols, which is
international, precise, logical, and simple. The International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) specifies rules for chemical names and symbols.

element: a pure substance that cannot be
broken down into simpler substances by
chemical means (empirical definition); a sub-
stance composed entirely of only one kind of
atom (theoretical definition)

compound: a pure substance that can be
broken down by chemical means to produce
two or more pure substances (empirical defi-
nition); a substance containing atoms of more
than one element combined in fixed propor-
tions (theoretical definition)

metal: an element that is a conductor of
electricity, malleable, ductile, and lustrous

SATP (standard ambient tempera-

ture and pressure): exactly 25°C and
100 kPa

STP (standard temperature and

pressure): exactly 0°C and 101.325 kPa

empirical definition: a statement that
defines an object or process in terms of
observable properties

nonmetal: an element that is generally a
nonconductor of electricity and is brittle

metalloid: an element located near the
“staircase line” on the periodic table; having
some metallic and some nonmetallic properties

IUPAC: the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry; the international body that
approves chemical names, symbols, and units

These rules are summarized in many scientific references, such as the Handbook
of Chemistry and Physics, and used all over the world.

For elements, the first letter (only) of the symbol is always an uppercase
letter. For example, the symbol for calcium is Ca, not CA, ca, or cA. New elements
are still being synthesized. There are rules for naming these new elements. The
names of new metallic elements end in “ium.” The new elements first get a tem-
porary name, with symbols consisting of three letters. Later permanent names
and symbols are given, by a vote of IUPAC representatives from each country.
The permanent name might reflect the country in which the element was dis-
covered, or pay tribute to a notable scientist.

Making Connections

4. Choose five household products. List the ingredients from their
product labels. Classify the ingredients as either elements or com-
pounds. Further classify each of the elements, including elements in
compounds, as metal, metalloid, or nonmetal.

tages: It has a low density and is easily cast, for example, into
cooking pots and components for engines. Use the Internet to
research the possible link between aluminum and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Do you consider aluminum to be a significant environmental
hazard?

Nonmetallic elements are rarely seen. The

erally used as raw materials to produce other
substances.

Why Set a Standard?

SATP, standard ambient temperature and
pressure, was established by interna-
tional agreement of scientists to approxi-
mate normal conditions in the laboratory.
For convenience and comparison, scien-
tists need to communicate the value of a
constant, such as density or solubility,
under the same conditions as other sci-
entists. Conditions such as these are
called standard conditions. It is often
easier to determine and more convenient
to use values for SATP than for STP. It’s
not much fun working at 0°C, and the
water keeps freezing!

7. Why would it be unwise for each country to choose its own names
and symbols for elements?

8. Classification is not restricted to science. To make the world easier to
understand, we classify music, food, vehicles, and people. Give an
example of a useful classification system that you have encountered
in your life. In what way is it useful? Describe a harmful example.
Why do you think it is harmful?

Before 1800, scientists distinguished elements from compounds by heating the
substances to find out if they decomposed. If the products they obtained after
cooling had different properties from the starting materials, then the experi-
menters concluded that decomposition had occurred, so the original substance
was a compound, rather than an element. This experimental design was the only
one known at that time.

In this investigation, you will test this experimental design by heating some
samples and classifying the substances as either elements or compounds. Carry
out the Procedure and complete the Prediction, Analysis, and Evaluation sec-
tions of the lab report.

You will use cobalt(II) chloride paper in a diagnostic test for water. If
cobalt(II) chloride paper is exposed to a liquid or vapour, and the paper turns
from blue to pink, then water is likely present. The presence of water above a
solid sample may indicate that decomposition has taken place.

Properties of Gold

Gold is easily identified as a metal because
of its properties. It is an excellent conductor
of electricity and so ductile that it can be
drawn into the very fine wires needed in tiny
electronic devices. It is so malleable that it
can be hammered into gold leaf, or rolled into
layers only a few atoms thick. Using this
property, it would be possible to roll 1 cm3 of
gold into a layer so thin and so flat that it
could cover the roof of your school.

Organizing the Elements

In 1800, 31 elements were known. By 1865, the number of identified elements
had more than doubled to 63. With the discovery of more and more elements,
scientists searched for a systematic way to organize their knowledge by classifying
the elements. Scientists were able to make more accurate and precise measure-
ments of mass, volume, and pressure in the course of their investigations. By
studying the reactions of various elements with oxygen and using the quantita-
tive relationships that emerged, scientists eventually determined the relative
atomic mass of each element. For example, atoms of carbon were found to have
a mass 12 times the mass of a hydrogen atom; and an oxygen atom has a mass 16
times that of a hydrogen atom. Atoms of hydrogen appeared to be the lightest, so

Solid, Liquid, or Gas?

When representing an element or compound
by its chemical formula, we can indicate its
state with a subscript: (s) means solid; (l)
means liquid; (aq) means “aqueous,” dis-
solved in water; and (g) means gaseous. All
of these states are at SATP—25°C and
100kPa—unless stated otherwise.

The Nature of Matter 15

a scale was devised in which hydrogen had an atomic mass of 1 unit. The relative
atomic masses of some common elements are shown in Table 2.

Johann Döbereiner (1780–1849) was among the first scientists to consider
the idea of trends among the properties of the elements. By 1829 he had noted a
similarity among the physical and chemical properties of several groups of three
elements. In each case, the middle element had an atomic mass about halfway
between the atomic masses of the other two. Lithium, potassium, and sodium
make up one such triad.

Döbereiner’s discovery is often referred to as the law of triads. However, for
a statement to be accepted as a law, evidence must first be collected from several
examples and replicated by many scientists. Laws must accurately describe and
explain current observations and predict future events in a simple manner. A 
law is a statement of accepted knowledge. In this regard, Döbereiner’s “law of
triads” was never really a law. In any event, at the time, Döbereiner’s idea was 
dismissed as coincidence.

In 1864, the English chemist John Alexander Newlands (1837–1898)
arranged all of the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass. He
noticed that similar physical and chemical properties appeared for every eighth
element. For example, the elements lithium, sodium, and potassium are all soft,
silvery-white metals. They are all highly reactive, and they form similar com-
pounds with chlorine. There is a strong “family” resemblance among them,
although the degree of reactivity increases as the atomic mass increases within
the family. Newlands noticed that rubidium and cesium, although they did not
follow the “eighth element” pattern, share properties with sodium, potassium,
and lithium. He therefore decided to include them in the same family.

The elements that follow (in atomic mass) each of these five in Newlands’s
arrangement—beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium—also
exhibit a strong family resemblance. Newlands, having an interest in opera and
music, drew a parallel between the repeating properties of every eighth chemical
element and the octave scale in music. Newlands called his discovery “the law of
octaves.” However, Newlands’s law of octaves seemed to be true only for elements
up to calcium. As a result, the idea was not generally accepted and drew criticism
and even ridicule from members of the scientific community.

At around the same time that Newlands announced his findings, a German
chemist, Julius Lothar Meyer (1830–1895), also arranged the elements in order
of atomic mass. Lothar Meyer thought he found a repeating pattern in the rela-
tive volumes of the individual atoms of known elements. Unlike Newlands,
Lothar Meyer observed a change in length of that repeating pattern. By 1868,
Lothar Meyer had developed a table of the elements that closely resembles the
modern periodic table. However, his work was not published until after the work
of Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), the scientist who is generally credited with
the development of the modern periodic table.

Mendeleev’s Periodic Table

While Döbereiner may have initiated the study of periodic (repeating) relation-
ships among the elements, it was the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev who was
responsible for publishing the first periodic law. Mendeleev’s periodic law stated
that elements arranged in order of increasing atomic mass show a periodic recur-
rence of properties at regular intervals.

In 1869, Mendeleev (Figure 5) reported observing repeated patterns in the
properties of elements, similar to the interpretations of Newlands and Meyer.
Mendeleev first created a table listing the elements in order of atomic mass in

Siberia, the youngest of 17 children. Whilst
employed as a chemistry professor, he
explored a wide range of interests including
fossil fuels, meteorology, and hot-air balloons.

vertical columns. Each column ended when the chemical properties of the ele-
ments started to repeat themselves, at which point a new column was started.

Mendeleev later published a revised periodic table of the elements. In this
table he listed all the elements known at that time in horizontal rows, in order of
atomic mass. The table is organized in such a way that elements with similar prop-
erties appear in the same column or group (Figure 6). This table made it very clear
that there were trends (sometimes called periodic trends) among the elements:
similar but gradually changing properties, such as melting and boiling points.

Mendeleev’s table contained some blank spaces where no known elements
appeared to fit. However, he had such confidence in his hypothesis that he pro-
posed that those elements had not yet been discovered. For example, in the peri-
odic table there is a gap between silicon, Si (28), and tin, Sn (118). Mendeleev
predicted that an element, which he called “eka-silicon” (after silicon), would
eventually be discovered and that this element would have properties related to
those of silicon and tin. He made detailed predictions of the properties of this
new element, using his knowledge of periodic trends. Sixteen years later, a new
element was discovered in Germany. The properties of this new element, germa-
nium, are listed in Table 3, beside the properties that Mendeleev had predicted
for eka-silicon. The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative predictions and their
eventual success made him and his periodic table famous.

1.1

No one in the scientific community at the time could explain why Mendeleev’s
predictions were correct—no acceptable theory of periodicity was proposed until
the early 1900s. Mendeleev was working on empirical evidence alone. This mystery
must have made the accuracy of his predictions even more astounding.

Practice

Understanding Concepts

9. (a) State the periodic law according to Mendeleev.
(b) What are the limitations of the periodic law? Do you think it could

be used to predict all of the properties of a new element?

10. Chlorine, fluorine, and bromine are a “triad” with increasing atomic
mass. The atomic mass of fluorine is 19 and of bromine is 80.
According to the law of triads, predict the atomic mass of chlorine.
Compare your prediction to the accepted value in the periodic table.

11. Name three scientists who contributed to the development of the
periodic table, and briefly describe the contributions of each.

12. Sulfur is a yellow solid and oxygen is a colourless gas, yet both ele-
ments are placed in the same column or family. What properties
might have led Mendeleev to place them in the same family?

13. In the 1890s, an entirely new family of elements was discovered. This
family consisted of unreactive gases called noble gases. Did this dis-
covery support Mendeleev’s periodic table? Explain briefly.

Reflecting

14. Science is considered by many people to be completely objective.
However, the history of science shows that this is not always the case.
Research the historical contributions of 19th-century scientists, such as
Newlands and Lothar Meyer, to the development of the modern peri-
odic law. Using your findings as evidence, write a brief commentary
on the objectivity of science and its social and personal dimensions.

The Modern Periodic Table

Mendeleev developed his periodic table when chemists knew nothing about the
internal structure of atoms. However, the beginning of the 20th century witnessed
profound developments in theories about subatomic particles. In 1911, a Dutch
physicist, A. van den Broek (1856–1917), suggested a rearrangement of the peri-
odic table according to atomic number. This led to a revision of the periodic law.

Names of Groups and Series of Elements

Some groups of elements and the two series of elements (those in the two hori-
zontal rows at the bottom of the periodic table) have traditional names that are
commonly used in scientific communication (Figure 9).

The position of hydrogen in the periodic table is a problem: It sometimes
behaves like a member of the alkali metals, sometimes like halogens, and some-
times in its own unique way. Hydrogen is sufficiently different to be in a class by
itself.

Although the periodic table has some limitations, scientists generally agree
that the evidence supporting its general principles, as well as its usefulness in
chemistry, make it an essential part of the study of chemistry.

Not Completely Inert

Although the noble gases are so stable and
unreactive that they remained undiscovered
until the late 1800s, they can be made, under
certain circumstances, to form compounds.
The first known reaction involving a noble gas
was a Canadian achievement. In 1962 Neil
Bartlett (b. 1932), a scientist at the University
of British Columbia, created a compound from
xenon, platinum, and fluorine.

sequence, but the shape of the table makes it difficult to print on a page while still
including useful descriptions of each element.

The periodic table is usually printed in the form shown in Figure 8, with two
separate rows at the bottom. Note the following important features:

• a group—elements with similar chemical properties in a vertical column in
the main part of the table;

• a period—elements, arranged in a horizontal row, whose properties change
from metallic on the left to nonmetallic on the right;

• the “staircase line”—a zigzag line that separates metals (to the left) from
nonmetals (to the right);

• the physical state of each element at SATP (in this case red for gases, blue
for liquids; the remainder are solids);

• group numbers 1 to 18.

Understanding Concepts

15. Create a table with five columns. At the top of the columns write the
following headings: Element name; Atomic symbol; Atomic number;
Group number; and State at SATP. In the left-hand column, write the
names of all the elements in the second period, then complete the
table.

alkali metals
soft, silver-coloured elements; solids at SATP; 
exhibit metallic properties; react violently with 
water to form basic solutions and liberate 
hydrogen gas; react with halogens to form 
compounds similar to sodium chloride, 
NaCl(s); stored under oil or in a vacuum to 
prevent reaction with air

halogens
may be solids, liquid, or gases at SATP; 
exhibit nonmetallic properties—not 
lustrous and nonconductors of electricity; 
extremely reactive, with fluorine being the 
most reactive; react readily with hydrogen 
and metals

noble gases
gases at SATP; low melting and boiling 
points; extremely unreactive, making them 
especially interesting to chemists; krypton, 
xenon, and radon reluctantly form 
compounds with fluorine; radon 
is  radioactive

representative elements 
includes both metals and nonmetals from 
Groups 1, 2, and 13 through 17; may be 
solids, liquids, or gases at SATP; called 
representative because they most closely 
follow the periodic law; many form 
colourful compounds

actinides
elements with atomic 
numbers 89 to 102

transuranic elements
synthetic (not naturally occurring) 
elements with atomic numbers 93 
or greater (beyond uranium)
   

transition metals
exhibit a wide range of chemical and physical 
properties; characteristically strong, hard metals 
with high melting points; good conductors of 
electricity; variable reactivity; form ions with 
variable charges; many react with oxygen to form 
oxides; some will react with solutions of strong 
acids to form hydrogen gas

alkaline earth metals 
light, very reactive metals; solids at SATP; 
exhibit metallic properties; form oxide coatings 
when exposed to air; react with oxygen to 
form oxides with the general chemical 
formula, MO(s); all except beryllium will react 
with hydrogen to form hydrides with the 
general chemical formula XH2; react with 
water to liberate hydrogen

the melting point of Rb, the element immediately below K in
the group.

22 Chapter 1

1.2 Developing a Model of the Atom
In all aspects of our lives, we can achieve understanding through observations
(experience). The same is true in science: Understanding comes from observing
the natural world and trying to make sense of those observations. All scientific
knowledge can be classified as either empirical (observable) or theoretical (non-
observable). Generally, empirical knowledge comes first, and can be as simple as
a description or as complex as a powerful scientific law. For example, the phys-
ical and chemical properties of some elements were known empirically for thou-
sands of years before we had a theory to explain these properties. This is a
common occurrence: Empirical knowledge is usually well developed before any
explanation is generally accepted within the scientific community. Although sci-
entific laws are important statements summarizing considerable empirical
knowledge, they contain no explanation. For an explanation—an answer to the
question “Why?”—a theory is required.

So far in this chapter, you have encountered only empirical knowledge of ele-
ments, based on what has been observed. But why do the properties of elements
vary across the periodic table? Why are groups of elements similar in their phys-
ical and chemical properties? Can we explain the chemical formulas of com-
pounds formed from elements? An answer to these and other questions about
elements requires a theory about what makes up elements.

Curiosity leads scientists to try to explain nature in terms of what cannot be
observed. This step—formulating ideas to explain observations—is the essence
of theoretical knowledge in science. Albert Einstein referred to theoretical
knowledge as “free creations of the human mind.”

It is more challenging to communicate theoretical knowledge than empirical
knowledge because ideas are, by definition, abstract and cannot be seen.
Theoretical knowledge can be communicated in a variety of ways such as words,
symbols, models, and analogies. The difference between an analogy and a model
is not always obvious. Models are representations (Figure 1). Analogies are com-
parisons. For example, some properties of a liquid can be explained using the
analogy of a crowd of people in a confined space.

Theories are dynamic; they continually undergo refinement and change. To
be acceptable to the scientific community, theories must

• describe observations in terms of non-observable ideas;
• explain observations by means of ideas or models;
• successfully predict results of future experiments; and
• be as simple as possible in concept and application.

the drawbacks? To help you decide, separate your findings into
two categories: advantages and drawbacks. Write a paragraph

The Nature of Matter 23

Have you ever tried to figure out the contents of a package you weren’t allowed
to open? Such an object is often referred to as a “black box.” The atom is a good
example of a black box. Although, by definition, we can never open a black box,
we can perform operations on the box that will help us to learn more about what
goes on inside it. In this activity, you will be provided with a sealed container
which, together with its contents, represents a black box. You are expected to
investigate your black box and provide a detailed description of it. Your descrip-
tion should help you to develop a model of your black box.

1. Obtain a “black box.”

2. Manipulate the box in a variety of different ways, without opening or dam-
aging the box. Record the results as you proceed.

3. Write a preliminary description of the object inside the box.

4. Test your model and try to improve it by doing further manipulations.

gating the nature of the atom?

(f) Everyday life provides us with many examples of black boxes—things or
relationships that we cannot break open to look inside. What is a black box
for some may not be for others. Give three examples of black boxes that
you have encountered.

Early Greek Theories of Matter

The Greek philosopher Democritus (460?–370? B.C.) first proposed an atomic
theory of matter in the 5th century B.C. According to Democritus, all matter
could be divided into smaller and smaller pieces until a single indivisible particle
was reached. He called this particle an atom. He believed that different atoms are
of different sizes, have regular geometric shapes, and are in constant motion. He
also believed that there is empty space between atoms.

Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) severely criticized Democritus’s theory, arguing that
the idea of atoms in continuous motion in a void is illogical. The concept of a
void was very controversial at the time, and of course there was no evidence that
a completely empty space could exist. Instead, Aristotle supported the four-

Theoretical Knowledge

There is a range of types of theoretical
knowledge, just as there is for empirical
knowledge.
• Theoretical descriptions are specific state-

ments based on theories or models. For
example, “a molecule of water is com-
posed of two hydrogen atoms and one
oxygen atom.”

• Theoretical hypotheses are ideas that are
untested or tentative. For example, “protons
are composed of quarks that may them-
selves be composed of smaller particles.”

• Theoretical definitions are general state-
ments that characterize the nature of a sub-
stance or a process. For example, a solid is
theoretically defined as “a closely packed
arrangement of particles, each vibrating
about a fixed location in the substance.”

• Theories are comprehensive sets of ideas
that explain a large number of observa-
tions. For example, the concept that
matter is composed of atoms is part of
atomic theory; atomic theory explains
many of the properties of materials.

element theory of matter. Proposed by Empedocles a century earlier (c. 495–435
B.C.), the theory was based on the idea that all matter is made up of four basic
substances: earth, water, air, and fire. Aristotle and his followers believed that
each of these basic substances had different combinations of four specific quali-
ties: dry, moist, cold, and hot (Figure 2). Aristotle’s theory of the structure of
matter was the prevailing model for almost 2000 years, including the period of
alchemy in the Middle Ages (Figure 3). The demise of Aristotle’s model followed
the scientific revolution in physics and the new emphasis, in the 18th century, on
quantitative studies. Careful observations showed that too many of the explana-
tions and predictions using Aristotle’s theory were false. Scientists and philoso-
phers needed a new theory with a different model of matter. This led to the
revival of the atom concept.

Dalton’s Atomic Theory

John Dalton (1766–1844), an English scientist and schoolteacher, proposed
explanations for many of the known laws describing the behaviour of matter.
Dalton expanded upon the atomic theory proposed by Democritus. This
expanded theory was first introduced in 1803, at last replacing Aristotle’s model
of matter. Dalton’s theory consisted of the following statements.

• All matter is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.
• All atoms of an element have identical properties.
• Atoms of different elements have different properties.
• Atoms of two or more elements can combine in constant ratios to form

new substances.
• In chemical reactions, atoms join together or separate from each other but

are not destroyed.

According to Dalton’s theory, atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a
chemical reaction. Since atoms are indivisible, and are only rearranged during
chemical reactions, you must end up with the same number and kinds of atoms
after a chemical reaction as you had at the beginning. Therefore, there will be no
change in mass during chemical reactions. This explains the law of conservation of
mass. Dalton’s theory also suggested that atoms combine to form molecules in a
fixed ratio in a given chemical reaction. Since the atoms of an element have identical
properties, such as mass, and combine in constant ratios, every compound must
have a fixed, definite composition. This explains the law of constant composition.

This introduction of atomic theory to the scientific world was followed by a
period of intense investigation into the nature of matter. As a result of this inves-
tigation, Dalton’s statements suggesting that the atom is indivisible and that all
atoms of a given element have identical properties are no longer considered
valid. Nonetheless, Dalton’s theory proved very successful in explaining the laws
of conservation of mass and constant composition.

Development of Atomic Theory from 1803 to 1920

By the late 1800s, several experimental results conflicted with Dalton’s atomic
theory. Technological advances made possible the construction of evacuated
glass tubes fitted with an electrode at either end. The apparatus eventually
became known as a cathode ray tube, named for the electrical discharge of par-
ticles assumed to be travelling from the negative electrode (or cathode) to the
positive electrode (or anode). Several scientists used this apparatus in attempts
to determine the composition of the atom. In one such experiment, conducted
in 1897, J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) used a modified cathode ray tube to measure

alchemy: a medieval chemical philosophy
or practice, the principal goals of which were
to transmute elements (e.g., lead to gold), to
cure all illnesses, and to manufacture an
essence that would allow long life

quantitative: involving measurements
related to number or quantity 

law of conservation of mass: the
law stating that during a chemical reaction
matter is neither created nor destroyed

law of constant composition: the
law stating that compounds always have the
same percentage composition by mass

Figure 2

In Aristotle’s model of matter, each basic sub-
stance, or element, possesses two of four
essential qualities. For example, earth is dry
and cold; fire is dry and hot. This model was
based on logical thinking, but not on experi-
mentation.

Alchemists sought a method for trans-
forming other metals into gold. Although
they failed in their quest, they discovered
new elements and compounds and devel-
oped many experimental procedures that

the mass of the particle and its electric charge. From his analysis of the results,
which included calculating the mass-to-charge ratio for the mysterious particles,
Thomson made a bold suggestion. He proposed that the cathode rays were sub-
atomic particles: a subdivision of the matter from which all elements are built.
Thomson had hypothesized the existence of electrons.

With this new idea, Thomson developed a new model of the atom: He sug-
gested that negatively charged electrons are distributed inside the atom, which is
a positively charged sphere consisting mostly of empty space (Figure 4(a)). In
1904, Japanese scientist Hantaro Nagaoka (1865–1950) represented the atom as
a large, positively charged sphere surrounded by a ring of negative electrons
(Figure 4(b)). Until 1911, there was no evidence to contradict either of these
models.

In 1911, an experiment was performed that tested the existing atomic
models. The experiment was designed by Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) and
involved shooting alpha particles (small, positively charged particles produced by
radioactive decay) through very thin pieces of gold foil. Based on J. J. Thomson’s
model of the atom and his belief that the atom was composed mostly of empty
space, Rutherford predicted that all the alpha particles would travel through the
foil largely unaffected by the atoms of gold. Although most of the alpha particles
did pass easily through the foil, a small percentage of particles was deflected at
large angles (Figure 5). Based on this evidence, Rutherford hypothesized that an
atom must contain a positively charged core, the nucleus, which is surrounded
by a predominantly empty space containing negative electrons (Figure 6, page 26).
By finding the percentage of deflected alpha particles and the deflection angles,
Rutherford determined that only a very small portion of the total volume of an
atom could be attributed to the nucleus.

Despite its tiny volume, most of the mass of an atom is believed to be con-
centrated in the nucleus. Consequently, the nucleus is often described as a dense
central core that is massive compared to the electrons. In 1914, Rutherford
coined the word proton for the smallest unit of positive charge in the nucleus.

In 1932, James Chadwick’s experiments led him to modify Rutherford’s
atomic model. Chadwick (1891–1974) demonstrated that atomic nuclei must
contain heavy neutral particles as well as positive particles. These neutral sub-
atomic particles are called neutrons. Most chemical and physical properties of
elements can be explained in terms of these three subatomic particles—elec-
trons, protons, and neutrons (Table 1, page 26). An atom is composed of a
nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, and a number of electrons equal to
the number of protons; an atom is electrically neutral.

1.3 Understanding Atomic Mass
The number of protons in the nucleus determines the identity of an element and
is referred to as that element’s atomic number (Z). The concept of atomic
number was developed by H.G.J. Moseley (1887–1915), an English physicist,
subsequent to the results of Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiments.
Moseley’s research work with X rays showed that the nucleus of each element has
its own, unique positive charge. This positive charge increases by one as we
progress, element by element, through Mendeleev’s periodic table. Moseley was
the first to recognize the relationship between atomic number and nuclear
charge: They are equal. This discovery provided new insight into the periodic
table and a rationale for listing the elements in order of the number of protons
in the nucleus. Since atoms are electrically neutral, the atomic number also rep-
resents the number of electrons in an atom of an element.

By 1932, scientists had determined that the nucleus consists of protons
(which are positively charged) and neutrons (which are neutral). Since both neu-
trons and protons are much more massive than electrons, and both reside in the
nucleus, the mass of the atom is related to the number of nuclear particles (pro-

nucleus

To explain the results of his experiment,
Rutherford suggested that an atom consisted
mostly of empty space, and that most of the
alpha particles passed nearly straight through
the gold foil because these particles did not
pass close to a nucleus.

Tiny but Massive

The word “massive” is used in everyday lan-
guage to mean “very big,” “huge,” “enor-
mous.” In science it has a slightly different
meaning: “having a relatively large mass for
its size.” So, a tiny nucleus can be massive,
but an enormous hot-air balloon cannot!

tons and neutrons). The sum of the number of nuclear particles in an atom is
known as the mass number (A) of the atom. The number of neutrons in an atom
(neutron number, N) of a given element can be calculated as follows:

number of neutrons = mass number – atomic number

N = A – Z

According to Figure 1, an atom of fluorine may be represented as 199F. While
the value for Z can be read directly from the periodic table, A (the mass number)
is a whole-number approximation of the average atomic mass as given by the
periodic table. Using this information, we can easily find the number of protons,
electrons, and neutrons in an atom of any given element. In the case of fluorine,
the average atom contains 9 protons and 9 electrons. Subtracting 9 from 19, we
find that the atom of fluorine also contains 10 neutrons. Similarly, an atom of
sodium could be represented as 2311Na and would consist of 11 protons, 11 elec-
trons, and 12 neutrons.

23
11Na can also be written as Na-23 or sodium-23, where 23 is the mass

number. This is acceptable and unambiguous because sodium always has 11 pro-
tons, so we understand that its atomic number is 11. You should be familiar with
all three methods of notation.

Isotopes

Frederick Soddy (1877–1956), a colleague of Rutherford’s, proposed that the
number of neutrons can vary from atom to atom within the same element. Soddy
called these variations isotopes. An isotope is a form of an element in which the
atoms have the same number of protons as all other forms of that element, but a
different number of neutrons. In other words, isotopes will have the same atomic
number (Z) but different neutron numbers (N) and so different mass numbers
(A). The two most abundant isotopes of chlorine are found to be 3517Cl and 

37
17Cl.

Atoms of each isotope contain 17 protons and 17 electrons. However, an atom of
chlorine-35 has 18 neutrons while an atom of chlorine-37 has 20.

Hydrogen has three different isotopes. More than 99% of all hydrogen atoms
contain a single proton and no neutrons. The rest of the atoms represent the iso-
topes deuterium and tritium. An atom of deuterium contains one proton and

one neutron while an atom of tritium contains a proton and two neutrons in its
nucleus.

It is the protons and electrons in atoms that are largely responsible for
determining the element’s chemical behaviour. Consequently, isotopes of the
same element share chemical properties despite their slight difference in mass.
However, their physical properties can vary considerably. For example, water
containing hydrogen in the form of deuterium is known as heavy water and is
represented by the chemical formula D2O. Its use in CANDU nuclear reactors
will be discussed later.

Since atoms are so small, their masses are very low. It is therefore very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to measure the mass of an atom by conventional means.
Instead, we compare atomic masses to a standard in order to determine a relative
scale. At one time hydrogen, being the smallest and lightest of the elements, was
used as the standard. However, since the 1960s, scientists have compared the rel-
ative atomic mass (A

r
) of the elements to that of an isotope of carbon, carbon-

12 (Figure 2). By convention, an atom of carbon-12 has a mass of 12 atomic mass
units. Therefore, we define the unified atomic mass unit (u) as 1/12 of the mass
of a carbon-12 atom. On this scale the proton and the neutron both have a mass
close to 1 u while the electron has a mass of 0.000 55 u.

While some elements have only one isotopic form, most elements exist nat-
urally as a mixture of several isotopes. A mass spectrometer (Figure 3) is a
device that can be used to determine the atomic mass as well as the relative
abundance of each isotope present in an element. In a mass spectrometer,
gaseous atoms or molecules are accelerated by an electric field and bombarded
by high-energy electrons. These speeding electrons knock electrons away from
some of the particles being tested, leaving them as positively charged ions. The
ions pass through a magnetic or electric field, which bends (deflects) the path
they follow. The degree of deflection depends on their mass-to-charge ratio. The
lower the mass of the ion, the more it is deflected. By this means, scientists have
found that the average sample of the element chlorine consists of 75.77% chlo-
rine-35 and 24.23% chlorine-37. According to the periodic table, the atomic
mass of chlorine is 35.45 u. This value represents a weighted average of the
atomic masses of each of the isotopes of the element. Understandably, given the
greater abundance of the chlorine-35 isotope, this value is much closer to 35 u
than to 37 u.

Exceptional Hydrogen

Hydrogen seems to be an exception to every
rule in chemistry. Normally, the chemical
symbol of an element does not vary, even for
different isotopes. Once again, hydrogen is
the exception: Deuterium is represented by
the symbol D and tritium is represented by
the symbol T. D is actually 21H or H–2, and T
is actually 31H or H–3.

Radioisotopes

Many elements have one or more isotopes that are unstable. Atoms of unstable
isotopes decay, emitting radiation as their nucleus changes. Depending on the
isotope, these nuclear changes might happen very quickly or extremely slowly.
And the radiation they emit could be fairly harmless or very dangerous to living
cells. Isotopes that can decay in this way are known as radioisotopes and are said
to be radioactive. Numerous experiments have shown that radioisotopes give off
three types of radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (Table 1).

An alpha particle is composed of two protons and two neutrons, which is
equivalent to a 42He nucleus. (Because it carries no electrons it has a charge of 2+.
Its charge is usually omitted in nuclear equations.) The radioactive decay of
uranium-238, which results in the production of an alpha particle, alters the
composition of its nucleus, producing thorium-234:

The alpha particle emitted in this radioactive decay travels at a fairly high
speed (approximately 1.6 × 104 km/s).

Beta particles are high-energy electrons (and therefore carry a charge of 1–)
travelling at much higher speeds than an alpha particle (approximately 
1.3 × 105 km/s). When tritium (31H) decays, a beta particle is produced:

1H →

2He � �1

0 e

Evidence suggests that the beta particle, or high-energy electron, results from
the conversion of a neutron into a proton and an electron. Therefore, helium-3
is produced as the number of neutrons in the tritium nucleus decreases by 1 and
the number of protons increases.

Gamma radiation refers to high-energy electromagnetic waves. The emis-
sion of a gamma ray alone does not result in any changes to the mass number or
atomic number of an isotope. However, other types of radiation (which do result
in a change in either the atomic number or the mass number) often occur along
with gamma radiation.

The discovery of radioactive decay, in a series of investigations by Harriet
Brooks (1876–1933), a Canadian scientist, was a real breakthrough in developing
atomic theory: Here was evidence that an atom of one element could sponta-
neously change into another element. Dalton’s atomic theory of “tiny indivisible
particles” that were unchanging was completely put to rest.

Every radioisotope has a characteristic property called its half-life. The half-
life of a radioactive substance is the time taken for half of the original number of
radioactive atoms to decay. The half-lives of radioisotopes vary considerably. For
example, cesium-142 has a half-life of 5 × 1015 a (a means years; the SI symbol is
based on “annum”—Latin for “year”), while polonium-216 has a half-life of only
0.16 s. Consider the example of a 1000-g sample of radium-226. This radioiso-
tope has a half-life of 1590 a. After 1590 a, only 500 g of the original sample
would be radium-226. The other 500 g would have decayed to form other ele-
ments. After an additional 1590 a, 250 g of the remaining 500 g of radium-226
would have decayed, leaving only 250 g of of the original radium-226.

Sample Problem 2

The half-life of cesium-137 is 30 a. What mass of cesium-137 would remain from
a 12-g sample after 30 a? After 60 a?

Solution

After 30 a (one half-life), 6.0 g of cesium-137 would remain.
After 60 a (two half-lives), 3.0 g of cesium-137 would remain.

Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 a. It emits a beta particle as it decays. Small
amounts of this isotope occur naturally in the atmosphere, where it reacts with
oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide. Carbon-14 is absorbed by plants
when a mixture of radioactive and nonradioactive carbon dioxide is taken in
during photosynthesis. Carbon-14 then finds its way into other living organisms
through the food chain. When a living organism dies, it stops taking in material,
including carbon. Radioactive decay will gradually reduce the amount of carbon-
14 present in its tissues. As a result, the ratio of radioactive carbon to nonra-
dioactive carbon present in the organism will gradually decrease. Comparing this
ratio to the normal ratio present in a living organism provides a measure of the

half-life: the time it takes for one-half the
nuclei in a radioactive sample to decay

time elapsed since the organism’s death. The practice of measuring the 
carbon-14:carbon-12 ratio is known as carbon-14 dating.

Nonliving materials, such as rocks, can be dated using potasssium-40.
Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 × 109 a, which allows it to be used to date objects
too old to be dated by the carbon-14 method. (As the amount of carbon-14 left in
a sample becomes very small, the accuracy of the dating becomes increasingly less
reliable.) Potassium-40 dating allows the investigator to set the date when the rock
solidified and stopped exchanging chemicals with its surroundings.

As you can see by these examples, naturally occuring radiation is all around
us. It comes from space, soil, and even food.

The radiation produced by radioactive elements can be harnessed for a wide
variety of uses. In foods, radiation can be used to kill bacteria and prevent
spoilage. Radioisotopes are also widely used in medicine: Cancer patients are
treated with cancer-killing radiation from cobalt-60 and radium-226.

The ability of radiation to destroy cells, however, is not always an advantage.
It can pose great danger, causing normal cells to mutate or even die. Acute expo-
sure to radiation can cause severe skin burns; long-term, chronic exposure can
result in various forms of cancer, birth defects, and sterility in all animals. While
radiation adds immensely to our standard of living, many risks are associated
with it. We must constantly evaluate the balance between risk and benefit in our
application of radioisotopes.

In this activity you will use a model of a sample of radioactive material. By
removing the “decayed nuclei” from the sample after each “half-life,” and
counting the remaining nuclei, you will collect quantitative data that can be used
to plot a graph of half-life. This graph can then be used for prediction purposes.

34 Chapter 1

Nuclear Power and Nuclear Waste

A Canadian-designed nuclear reactor system known as CANDU makes use of a
naturally occurring radioisotope of uranium: uranium-235. The fuel in a
CANDU reactor is in the form of pellets that contain uranium oxide, prepared
from uranium ore. About 0.7% of the uranium in the pellets is U-235. The pel-
lets are assembled into a fuel bundle that is placed into the calandria, or reaction
vessel (Figure 5). A U-235 atom undergoes nuclear fission when a “slow” neutron
collides with its nucleus, resulting in the formation of two lighter nuclei. This
reaction also produces more neutrons and releases a considerable amount of
energy (Figure 6). When these new neutrons are released, they are travelling very
quickly—too quickly to cause further fission reactions. To be useful (continue
the chain reaction by colliding with other U-235 nuclei), the neutrons must be
slowed down. The substance used to slow the neutrons is called the moderator.
In CANDU reactors the moderator is heavy water (water that contains deu-
terium instead of hydrogen). Heavy water is also used to cool the fuel bundles in
a CANDU reactor. The heavy water is pressurized to prevent it from boiling. The
hot heavy water is used to heat ordinary water, producing the steam necessary to
turn turbines connected to electric generators.

Once the fuel rods have been used, they are removed from the calandria. At
the moment, the spent fuel rods are being stored in huge indoor pools of water
at the nuclear power stations. On removal, the fuel rods are much more radioac-
tive than they first were. They now contain U-238 and Pu-239 (formed when 
U-238 absorbs a neutron and decays by double beta emissions.) Pu-239 has a
half-life of 2.44 × 104 a.

The use of nuclear energy to supply electricity is not associated with imme-
diate environmental pollution such as acid rain, greenhouse gases, or the emis-
sion of toxic gases, all of which result from the burning of fossil fuels. Because of
this, nuclear energy plants can be built close to where the power is needed. Since
fresh water is required to circulate through the reactors’ condensers, CANDU
reactors must be constructed near a large body of water. The largest CANDU
reactors in Canada are located on the shores of the Great Lakes at Bruce,
Pickering, and Darlington.

Some aquatic organisms are affected by the waste heat carried by the water that
cycles back into the lakes. Ground water contamination from radioactive tailings at
uranium ore mines and the disposal of radioactive wastes are additional problems
associated with the use of nuclear power. Plutonium, a waste material from
CANDU nuclear reactors, can be used in the construction of nuclear weapons.

In April 1986, a partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor core occurred at
Chernobyl in what is now Ukraine (Figure 7). More than 100 000 people were
exposed to high levels of radiation when a steam explosion occurred in a nuclear
power plant. Significant amounts of radioactive materials were released into the
environment and hundreds of people who lived near the plant were treated for
acute radiation sickness. Since the incident at Chernobyl, medical investigators
have been tracking an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer and birth
defects in the area. The reactor at Chernobyl was not a CANDU reactor, but the
accident there raised concerns about the safety of all types of reactors.

What to do with spent nuclear fuel is a thorny issue. Many suggestions have
been made. The most popular at the moment is storage: keeping it where it is, in
the pools within the nuclear facilities. This requires constant maintenance, and
the storage sites are necessarily right next to large bodies of water, which are used
for drinking water.

A longer-term alternative is disposal: for example, sealing the spent fuel in a
glasslike compound and placing it in disused mines deep underground in stable
rock. The concern with using underground sites for storage is that rock forma-
tions can shift and become unstable with the normal slow movement of Earth’s
crust. This movement would probably not be significant in our lifetimes, but the
spent fuel will be radioactive for thousands of years. Engineers have identified
some sites they consider to be particularly stable. One underground storage site
being used by U.S. nuclear plants is in salt deposits under the Chihuahuan Desert
of New Mexico. Although disposal sites have been identified in Canada, currently
none has been approved.

1.4 Toward a Modern Atomic Theory
Rutherford’s model of the atom raised some difficult questions. If the nucleus of
an atom contained several positive protons that repelled each other, how did it
stay together? Why didn’t the negatively charged electrons rush toward and crash
into the positively charged nucleus? In response to the first question, Rutherford
suggested the idea of a nuclear force—an attractive force within the nucleus—
that was much stronger than the electrostatic force of repulsion. The answer to
the second question—why the electrons did not fall in to be “captured” by the
nucleus—required a bold new theory created by a young Danish physicist named
Niels Bohr (Figure 1).

Sections 1.2–1.3 Questions

Figure 1

Niels Bohr (1885–1962) developed a new
theory of atomic structure and communicated
this theory with an innovative model of the
atom. For this work he won the Nobel Prize
for Physics in 1922.



38 Chapter 1

According to Bohr’s theory, electrons within an atom can possess only cer-
tain discrete energies, called energy levels. Because of this, electron energy is said
to be quantized. Each energy level, Bohr proposed, is associated with a fixed dis-
tance from the nucleus. (Later evidence showed that this is not entirely accurate.)
In the Bohr model, an electron with a particular energy travels along a three-
dimensional pathway called a shell or orbit (Figure 2).

These shells are designated by the principal quantum number, n, which can
be any positive integer from 1 to infinity. Historically, these shells have also been
designated by the symbols K, L, M, N, ... (Figure 3).

Bohr’s theory depended on these assumptions:

• that an electron can travel indefinitely within an energy level without
losing energy;

• that the greater the distance between the nucleus of the atom and the
energy level, the greater the energy required for an electron to travel in that
energy level; and

• that an electron cannot exist between orbits, but can move to a higher,
unfilled orbit if it absorbs a specific quantity of energy, and to a lower,
unfilled orbit if it loses energy.

Bohr theorized that if additional energy is supplied to an electron in a given
energy level, then the electron can “jump” to a higher, unfilled energy level, far-
ther away from the nucleus (Figure 4). Bohr referred to this kind of jump as a
transition. The quantity of energy (a quantum) required to cause a transition is
equivalent to the difference in energy between the energy levels. When an elec-
tron drops back to a lower energy level, it releases an equivalent amount of
energy.

When an electron is in the lowest energy level that it can occupy, it is said
to be in its ground state. Similarly, when all the electrons in an atom are in the
lowest possible energy levels, the atom is said to be in its ground state. In addi-
tion, Bohr suggested that the properties of the elements could be explained by
the arrangement of electrons in orbits around the nucleus. For instance, Bohr

energy level: a state with definite and
fixed energy in which an electron is allowed
to move

orbit: a circular (spherical) path in which
the electron can move around the nucleus

transition: movement of an electron from
one energy level to another

ground state: the lowest energy level
that an electron can occupy

Note that all of these definitions are based
on Bohr’s theory, and so are theoretical.

Since orbits are three-dimensional path-
ways, they are often described as spher-
ical shells arranged concentrically about
the nucleus of an atom.

Nobel Prizewinners

Bohr developed his ideas on electrons, energy,
and spectra from the work of Max Planck
(1858–1947), who first suggested that energy
is quantized. This earned Planck the 1918
Nobel Prize in physics. Bohr also made use of
Einstein’s work on the photoelectric effect (the
change in energy of an atom as it absorbs or
emits a photon of light). This, not the theory of
relativity, was the work for which Einstein
received the Nobel Prize in 1921!

hypothesized that the stable, unreactive nature of certain elements was due to
filled outermost energy levels.

The theory developed by Bohr was an attempt to explain empirical evidence
obtained from experiments involving hydrogen. When hydrogen gas is heated, it
emits a violet light. When this violet light is directed through a prism, it separates
into a series of coloured lines called a line spectrum. Hydrogen produces a line
spectrum consisting of four visible lines: red, blue-green, indigo, and violet
(Figure 5), although the violet line may not always be visible. The same results
can be obtained by passing electricity through a gaseous element at low pressure:
The gas will emit light of only certain wavelengths, which we can see as lines if
the light is passed through a prism (Figure 6, page 40).

These observations contrast with what we see when we shine white light
through a glass prism or a spectroscope: In this case, we see a blended pattern of
colour or a continuous spectrum. The colours of the spectrum (plural: spectra)
always appear in the same order: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and
finally red. A rainbow is an example of a continuous spectrum.

Bohr proposed the following explanation for the line spectrum of hydrogen:
When energy (heat or electricity) is supplied to hydrogen atoms, excited elec-
trons gain a certain quantity of energy. With this extra energy they jump from a
lower energy level to a higher energy level. As the electrons drop back to lower
energy levels they release energy corresponding to a few precise wavelengths
(Figure 5). Bohr’s theory was important because it explained both the stability of
electrons in atoms and atomic emission spectra, and it enabled scientists to cal-

culate the actual energies of the different energy levels within the hydrogen atom.
However, Bohr’s theory was not able to explain the more complex spectra of
other elements.

If the radiation produced by supplying energy to an unknown element is in the
visible range, we will see it as light. This light can be separated to produce a line
spectrum, which we can use to identify the element.

In this investigation you will observe, record, and compare the continuous
spectrum of white light as well as the line spectra of hydrogen and several
unknown elements. You will then identify the unknown elements by comparing
their observed line spectra with the published line spectra of several elements,
found in Appendix C. Complete the Analysis and Synthesis sections of the lab

The coloured lights given off by neon signs, streetlights, signal flares, fireworks,
and even distant stars all result from excited electrons moving from higher to
lower energy levels in atoms. Each element has a unique emission spectrum, so
when elements are heated in a flame, they will give the flame a characteristic
colour. We can use this technique to identify elements even when they are parts
of compounds. We can also determine the amount of the element present by
measuring the intensity of the light emitted. This technique, called flame emis-
sion spectroscopy, is used in many situations, including analyzing and estab-
lishing the geographic origin of ancient pieces of pottery.

Some elements show one or more particularly prominent lines in their line
spectra. We can make use of this phenomenon to find out which metal is present
in an unknown metallic compound. In this test, called a flame test, the unknown
sample is heated in a flame. The colour of the flame is observed and compared
against a chart of known flame colours.

Your aim in this activity is to observe, and create a key for, the colours pro-
duced when solutions of known metal compounds (mostly Group 1 and 2
metals) are heated to high temperature. You will be able to use this key to deter-
mine the identity of an unknown metallic compound. To establish this key, you
will draw samples of dissolved compounds from solids and solutions using a
wire, and then put the end of the wire into a flame.

hold the wire in the flame of the laboratory burner. Repeat the procedure
until the wire adds no colour to the flame.

4. Pick up a small amount of solid sodium nitrate with the wire loop. Hold
the end of the wire in the flame. Record your observations.

wire after each test. Record your observations.

10. Repeat the flame tests for potassium chloride and sodium chloride,
observing the results through cobalt glass. Record your results.

Analysis

a quick reference.

sodium chloride, and sodium chloride solution. What do these results 
indicate?

Nichrome Wire

What properties would you need in a wire
that is going to be repeatedly heated and
cooled, both wet and dry, and is going to hold
materials in a flame so that you can observe
their emission spectra? The wire must have a
high melting point, be very unreactive, and
produce no emission spectrum itself (at least,
at the temperatures generally used in the
lab). The wire that offers these properties is
called nichrome. It is an alloy of almost 80%
nickel and 20% chromium, with traces of sil-
icon, manganese, and iron.

The Quantum Mechanical Theory

Bohr made significant contributions to our current understanding of atomic
structure, especially in establishing the concept of atomic energy levels. However,
his theory of the atom was limited in its ability to predict the line spectra of
atoms other than hydrogen, as well as to account for certain details of atomic
structure. These shortcomings resulted in intense investigation that led in the
1920s to our modern atomic theory, sometimes known as quantum mechanics
theory. A crucial steppingstone along the way was the development of quantum
mechanics, which builds on the earlier idea that electrons within an atom can
possess only discrete quantities of energy. Quantum mechanics theory also

atom in which electrons are described in
terms of their energies and probability 
patterns



46 Chapter 1

retains the concept that electrons fill successive shells, each of which is designated
by the principal quantum number (n).

One important idea resulting from quantum mechanics, obtained by Werner
Heisenberg (1901–1976; famous for his Heisenberg uncertainty principle) in
1927, is that it is impossible to know precisely both the position and motion of
an electron at the same time. Unlike Bohr’s theory, which describes electrons
travelling in spherical orbits at precise distances from the nucleus, quantum
mechanics describes electrons within atoms in terms of their energy and proba-
bility patterns—that is, the probability of finding an electron of a specified
energy within a specific region of space about the nucleus. This region in space
is called the electron cloud (Figure 9).

It turns out that to fully designate all possible energies and probability pat-
terns, we must modify the atomic model by subdividing each shell or orbit into
an increasing number of subshells as the principal quantum number increases
(Table 1). Just as there is a maximum number of electrons possible for each shell,
there is a maximum number possible for each subshell. In the case of hydrogen,
the subshells within any given shell are all equivalent in energy—the same energy
as predicted by Bohr’s theory. For all other elements, the subshells within a given
shell have different energies. This concept becomes important in determining the
atomic structure and properties of elements within the periodic table. It also
accounts for the spectra of elements other than hydrogen (which Bohr’s theory
failed to do), since the emission lines result from electrons moving between levels
whose energies cannot be calculated solely from the value of n.

From his study of the periodic table, Bohr concluded that the maximum
number of electrons that can populate a given shell can be calculated from the
equation 2n2 (where n is the principal quantum number). According to this
equation, the first energy level could contain up to 2 × (1)2 or 2 electrons. The
second energy level could contain up to 2 × (2)2 or 8 electrons, while the third
energy level could contain up to 2 × (3)2 or 18 electrons. According to this
restricted theory, the 17 electrons of an atom of chlorine in the ground state
would be distributed among three shells. The first shell would be filled with 2 of
the 17 electrons. The second, or next highest, shell would be filled with 8 elec-
trons. Finally, with both the first and the second shells filled, the remaining 7
electrons would occupy the third shell. The electrons in the highest occupied
energy level are called valence electrons.

Notice that the first shell has space for two electrons, and there are two ele-
ments in the first period of the periodic table: hydrogen and helium. The second
shell has space for eight electrons, and there are eight elements in Period 2 (Li
through Ne). The 2n2 rule tells us that the n = 3 shell can contain a maximum of
18 electrons, so on the basis of Bohr’s theory we might expect there to be 18 ele-
ments in Period 3. In fact, there are only 8 elements in Period 3 (elements Na
through Ar). Why is this? Remember that quantum mechanics theory tells us
that the third shell is split into three subshells, each of which has a different
energy. The outermost (highest energy) subshell is very close in energy to the
first subshell of the next shell (n = 4). Experimental measurements show that,
once there are 8 electrons in the third shell, the fourth shell is used (in elements
K and Ca) before electrons are added to fill up the third shell. Similar effects are
also observed in subsequent periods.

According to Bohr’s theory, there is a pattern linking electron arrangements
to the periodic table for the representative elements:

• for the elements in Groups 1 and 2, the number of valence electrons corre-
sponds to the group number;

• in Groups 13 to 18, the number of valence electrons corresponds to the
second digit of the group number. For example, fluorine is found in Group
17 (VIIA) of the periodic table: It contains 7 valence electrons. Both chlo-
rine and fluorine are halogens and have 7 valence electrons. You already
know that the halogens share similar physical and chemical properties,
which allows them to be placed together in the same chemical group.

In general, representative elements in the same chemical group share not
only properties but also the same number of valence electrons—a powerful indi-
cator of the relationship between electron arrangement and periodic trends.

Elements within a group have the same number and distribution of valence elec-
trons, so we might expect them to exhibit the same chemical behaviour. Based
only on electron distribution, we would expect lithium and sodium, for example,
to behave in very much the same way. There are indeed similarities, but chemical
and physical properties of elements within groups are not identical. Instead, we
can see that there are variations, or trends, within each group. A property will
increase or decrease within a group as the atomic number increases. Why is that?
And is the change regular, or unpredictable?

many questions: Why do the properties of elements vary across the periodic

Describing Trends in the Periodic Table

There are many observable patterns in the chemical properties of elements.
Within a period, chemical reactivity tends to be high in Group 1 metals, lower in
elements toward the middle of the table, and increase to a maximum in the
Group 17 nonmetals. (The noble gases, of course, are the least reactive of any
group.) Metals react differently from nonmetals. Within a group of representa-
tive metals, such as the alkali metals, reactivity increases moving down the group;
within a group of nonmetals, reactivity decreases moving down the group
(Figure 1). Periodic trends such as these demonstrate the periodic nature of

chemical properties. But how can we explain periodicity? Why do the properties
of elements follow these trends? To answer these questions we must turn to
accepted theories of atomic structure and properties of the atom. We will look at
five properties—atomic radius, ionic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity,
and electronegativity—and try to explain them in terms of number of electrons
and energy levels.

Atomic Radius

Measuring the radius of a CD is easy: With a ruler, measure the distance from its
centre to its outside edge. Finding the radius of an atom—its atomic radius—is
a lot more complicated. For one thing, an atom is so small that all measurements
have to be made indirectly. For another, it is very difficult to know exactly where
an atom ends. Recall from our discussion of quantum theory that we can only
estimate the probability of an electron being in a certain place at a certain time.
So where is the outside edge of an atom?

Scientists have proposed several different answers to this question, with dif-
ferent definitions of atomic radius. We will simplify, and assume that the atomic
radius is one-half the distance between the nuclei of two atoms of the same ele-
ment, whether they are bonded (e.g., oxygen and nitrogen, Figure 2(a)) or not
bonded (e.g., the metallic elements, Figure 2(b)).

Figure 4, pages 52–53, shows the atomic radii of elements in the periodic
table. Note that, in general, the atomic radii decrease from left to right across
each period. We can explain this trend in atomic radius in terms of nuclear
charge and energy levels. As we move along a period from Group 1 to Group 17,
the number of protons in the nucleus increases in increments of one.
Consequently, the nuclear charge increases also. As the nuclear charge increases,
the number of filled inner energy levels, electrons shielding the outer electrons
from the nucleus, remains the same. Therefore, the strength of the attraction
between the nucleus and the valence electrons is stronger as protons are added.
This nuclear attraction pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus (decreases the
average distance of the valence electrons from the nucleus). Consequently, there
is a decrease in the size of the atom.

Chemists hypothesize that the atomic radius increases from top to bottom in
a given group because of the increasing number of energy levels. Each additional
energy level places electrons at a greater distance from the nucleus. This occurs
because the inner energy levels are filled with electrons, which serve to shield the
outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus. With each additional energy level
that is filled as you move down a group, the attractive force of the nucleus is
reduced by this shielding effect and the outer electrons are not as strongly
attracted. This decreased nuclear attraction felt by the outer electrons results in
a larger radius.

Ionic Radius

The removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of an ion.
When a valence electron is removed from an atom of lithium, a lithium ion is
formed. This ion has an ionic radius smaller than the atomic radius of the neu-
tral lithium atom (Figure 3) because there is one fewer electron shell. The charge
on this ion, because it is missing an electron, is positive.

Most representative elements lose only one or two electrons, to become ions
with charges of 1+ and 2+, but a few transition metals can lose even more elec-
trons. The ions in Figure 4 are the most common ion for each element.

54 Chapter 1

How can we explain the observed difference between atomic and ionic radii
of positive ions? In theory, each electron repels all of the other electrons. This
repulsion forces the electrons in the outer shells farther from the nucleus.
Removal of an electron from a neutral atom reduces the strength of these 
electron–electron repulsions. Positive ions are always smaller than the neutral
atom from which they are formed.

Look at the radii of the ions of Group 1 elements (Figure 4). See how the size
increases as you move down the group. This is because, for each successive ion in
the group, the outermost occupied energy level is farther from the nucleus. As we
move across Period 3 (from left to right), the values for ionic radii for the posi-
tive ions decrease. Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions each contain the same number of
electrons. However, for each successive positive ion in the period, the nuclear
charge is greater by 1+. Theoretically, each electron in an aluminum ion experi-
ences greater attraction than an electron in a magnesium ion. Similarly, each
electron in a magnesium ion experiences greater attraction than each electron in
a sodium atom. The attraction of the nucleus for the electrons in positive ions
increases across the period, and the ionic radius gets smaller.

When an atom gains an electron to form a negative ion, its radius increases.
For instance, the radius of a fluoride ion is over twice that of a fluorine atom
(Figure 5). In gaining an electron, repulsion among the electrons increases while
nuclear charge remains the same. The result is an enlarged electron cloud and a
greater ionic radius. Notice that the O2– and N3– ions are larger than the F– ion.
The theoretical explanation is much the same: These ions all have the same
number of electrons, but the number of protons is one less for the oxygen ion
and two less for the nitrogen ion.

Ionization Energy

Ionization energy is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from
an atom or ion in the gaseous state. This amount of energy is not constant,
depending on which electron is being removed. We generally specify which elec-
tron we are interested in. The first ionization energy is defined as the amount of
energy required to remove the most weakly held electron from a neutral atom.
This weakly held electron is always in the valence shell farthest from the nucleus,
where it is most shielded from the attractive force of the positive nuclear charge.
We can represent the ionization process as follows:

X(g) + energy → X
+
(g) + e

–

The second ionization energy is similarly defined as the energy required to
remove a second electron, this one from the gaseous positive ion.

It is easier to identify trends if numerical information is presented visually. In this
activity, you will create a graph of first ionization energy against atomic number.
You may find graphing software useful for this task.

56 Chapter 1

First Ionization Energy and Atomic Radius

Ionization energy and atomic radius are closely related properties. In general,
first ionization energies of metals are lower than those of nonmetals. From a
graph of first ionization energy versus atomic number, we notice that the ioniza-
tion energies decrease as you move down a group in the periodic table. This
decrease is related to the increase in size of the atoms from top to bottom of a
group. As the atomic radius increases, the distance between the valence electrons
and the nucleus also increases. As a result, the attraction between the negatively
charged electrons and the positive nucleus becomes weaker, so less energy is
required to remove the first valence electron.

As we look from left to right across a period, we can see a general increase in
ionization energy. Across any given period, the nuclear charge increases while the
shielding provided by the non-valence electrons remains the same, decreasing
the atomic radius. As a result the valence electrons are more strongly attracted to
the nucleus and more energy is required to remove an electron from the atom.
This makes sense if we relate it to our empirical knowledge: We know that ele-
ments on the left side of the periodic table are much more likely to lose electrons
(form positive ions) than are elements on the right side of the periodic table.

There is also a pattern in ionization energies involved in removing second,
third, and more electrons from an atom. As we have seen, the removal of an elec-
tron will lead to a reduced radius for the atom. The reduced radius strengthens
the attraction between the nucleus and its electrons, making the removal of each
extra electron progressively more difficult. There is always a large difference
between the amount of energy required to remove the last valence electron and
the much larger amount required to remove the first electron from the next
lower shell: An ion is most chemically stable when it has a full valence shell. This
explains why Group 1 elements form 1+ ions readily, but not 2+ ions.

Electron Affinity

As you know, a positively charged ion results from the removal of an electron from
a neutral atom. Ions can also be formed by adding an electron to an atom. When an
electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state, energy is usually released.

X(g) + e
– → X(g)

– + energy

The energy change associated with this ionization process is referred to as
electron affinity. You can think of electron affinity as the amount of energy an
atom (or ion) is willing to pay to buy another electron. To pick an extreme
example, when fluorine ionizes to form the fluoride ion (F–) 328.16 kJ of energy
is released for every mole of fluorine atoms ionized. This quantity of energy cor-
responds to the first electron affinity for fluorine. By convention, a positive elec-
tron affinity indicates a release of energy.

The addition of an electron to a neutral atom does not always result in a release
of energy (Table 3). Among the representative elements, those in Groups 2 and 18
have estimated first electron affinity values that are negative, indicating an absorp-
tion of energy. How can these negative first electron affinity values be explained?
The electron added in the ionization process is simultaneously attracted to the pos-
itive nucleus of the atom and repelled by the atom’s negative electrons. When the
attractive force outweighs the repulsive force, as is the case for most elements,
energy is released as an electron joins the atom to form an ion. When the repulsive
force is greater, energy must be injected to form the ion. This is demonstrated well
by second electron affinities, which are all negative. When we attempt to add a

second electron to an ion with a charge of 1– the repulsive forces experienced by
the approaching second electron are always greater than the attractive forces.

We can observe periodic trends in the electron affinities of the elements,
even if they are not strictly adhered to. We might expect that when an electron is
added to an atom of smaller radius, there is a greater attractive force between the
nucleus of atom and the new electron. Electron affinity and atomic radius
should, therefore, be inversely related. Since the size of atoms generally decreases
across a period, we might predict that electron affinity will increase as we move
from left to right within a period. This theoretical statement is supported by our
observations of chemical reactions: Group 17 elements have a much greater ten-
dency to form negative ions than do Group 1 elements.

Electronegativity

In 1922, an American chemist, Linus Pauling (1901-1994; Figure 6), proposed a way
of quantitatively describing the ability of an atom to attract electrons, combining
ionization energies, electron affinity, and some other measures of reactivity. This
scale is referred to as electronegativity. Pauling assigned a value of 4.0 to fluorine,
the element considered to have the greatest ability to attract electrons.
Electronegativity values for all other elements were assigned relative to the value for
fluorine.

The electronegativity of any given element is not constant; it varies
depending on the element to which it is bonded. Electronegativity is not a meas-
urement, in the sense that first ionization energy is a measurement. However,
electronegativity values do provide a means of predicting the nature of the force
that holds a pair of atoms together— a relationship that you will explore further
in Chapter 2. Approximate values for the electronegativity of the elements are
given in the periodic table at the back of this text.

You will plot a graph of electronegativity against atomic number.

Trends in Electronegativity

If you look at the electronegativity data in the periodic table, you will see that
electronegativity generally increases as you go along a period, from left to right.
Electronegativity decreases as you look down a given group on the periodic table.
The electronegativity values for elements at the bottom of a group are lower than
those for elements at the top of a group.

How can these trends be explained? Remember that atomic radii tend to
decrease along each period, from left to right, but increase down each group. The
attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus decreases as the distance
between them increases. The electronegativity also decreases. We can similarly
account for the increasing electronegativity across a period by the decreasing
atomic radius. Nonmetallic elements have a strong tendency to gain electrons.
Therefore, electronegativity is inversely related to the metallic properties of the
elements. While electronegativity increases across a period, metallic properties
decrease. Electronegativity decreases as we move down a group. This decrease in
electronegativity is accompanied by an increase in metallic properties.

Chemical Bonding
In caves we can sometimes see large structures known as stalagmites (Figure 1).
These formations are made of crystals of calcium carbonate, CaCO3(s), also
known as limestone. Calcium carbonate, as its name and formula suggest, is a
compound made up of three different elements. In addition to its crystalline
structure, calcium carbonate has high melting and boiling points and dissolves
to some extent in water. Many other compounds have similar physical and chem-
ical properties, such as ordinary table salt, sodium chloride. Other compounds,
such as water, H2O, and carbon dioxide, CO2, have significantly different prop-
erties. How can we explain these similarities and differences? The answer lies in
an understanding of the special forces of attraction, or bonds, that hold atoms
together in compounds. These forces form the foundation of chemical proper-
ties and reactions.

As you know, we often develop models to help us understand abstract con-
cepts. You are already familiar with several models: Bohr’s model of the atom; the
water cycle; the collision model. In this chapter we will develop theories and
models of chemical bonding (including the character of atomic bonds) to
explain the nature and behaviour of matter and to classify compounds.

2.1 Classifying Compounds
There are many ways to classify substances. You are already familiar with several
of them. For example, you know that iron is a solid at SATP (not a liquid or a
gas), a metal (not a nonmetal), and an element (not a compound). Similarly,
water is a liquid and a compound. In this section, we will look at ways of further
classifying compounds.

One category of compounds includes table salt (sodium chloride), NaCl(s),
bluestone (copper(II) sulfate), CuSO4(s), and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate),
NaHCO3(s). If you think about their chemical formulas, you might notice that
each one is made up of a metal joined to a nonmetal. These compounds are
called ionic compounds.

A second category includes sulfur dioxide, SO2, carbon dioxide, CO2, and
ammonia, NH3. Look at their formulas. What do you notice? They are all non-
metals combined with nonmetals, and are called molecular compounds.

Many ionic and molecular compounds can be found within your own home.
For example, window cleaners, household bleach, antacid tablets, and milk of
magnesia contain ionic compounds. Vegetable oil, plastics, and sugar contain
molecular compounds.

We can use electrical conductivity—the ability to conduct electricity—to
distinguish between ionic and molecular compounds: Ionic compounds (many
of which dissolve readily in water) form solutions that conduct electricity.
However, molecular compounds (some of which dissolve in water) form solu-
tions that generally do not conduct electricity. Of course, there are exceptions to
this generalization.

Substances that form solutions that conduct electricity are called elec-
trolytes. Their solutions are called electrolytic solutions.

Substances that form solutions that do not conduct electricity are called
nonelectrolytes. Their solutions are called nonelectrolytic solutions (Figure 1).

Just as a group of elements can share physical and chemical properties, so too can
a class of compounds. For instance, solid ionic compounds generally have very
high melting points and are brittle—they can often be crushed fairly easily into a
powder. Molecular compounds in solid form tend to have a softer or waxy texture,
and many have melting and boiling points so low that they are gases or liquids at
room temperature. If we can classify a substance as either ionic or molecular, we
should be able to predict some of its properties. Conversely, if we know some of the
properties of a substance, we can classify it as ionic or molecular.

There are several properties that we could take into account. Generally, the
simplest to investigate are physical properties, such as state at SATP, solubility in
water, and ability to conduct electricity in solution.

The purpose of this investigation is to test the generalizations you have
encountered about ionic and molecular compounds. Complete the
Hypothesis/Prediction, Analysis, Evaluation, and Synthesis sections of the lab

ducts electricity. Sugar will also dissolve in water. However, the sugar solution
will not conduct electricity, so sugar is a nonelectrolyte. It is a typical molecular
compound: Its solution with water does not conduct electricity. In Unit 3, you

about molecular acids: important exceptions to the rule that molecular solutions

a substance that you have classified as ionic, as it is an electrolyte. Like some other
ionic compounds that you are familiar with, for example, baking soda (sodium
hydrogen carbonate) and chalk (calcium carbonate), it is also brittle and has a
high melting temperature. How do we explain the formation and properties of
this compound?

You will recall, from Chapter 1, that atomic theory describes electrons
moving about the nucleus of the atom in energy levels, and that the electrons in
the outermost energy level are called the valence electrons. It is the valence elec-
trons of an atom that form chemical bonds.

According to atomic theory, ionic compounds are formed when one or more
valence electrons are transferred from a metal atom to a nonmetal atom. This
leaves the metal atom as a positive ion, or cation, and the nonmetal atom as a
negative ion, or anion. The two oppositely charged ions are attracted to each
other by a force called an ionic bond (Figure 1).

Explaining the Properties of Ionic Compounds

Ionic compounds have similar properties: They are solids at SATP with high
melting points, and they are electrolytes. We can hypothesize that these proper-
ties might be the result of the bonds formed between the ions, holding them
firmly in a rigid structure.

Although they are composed of ions, pure ionic compounds are electrically
neutral. Therefore, the sum total of the electrical charges on all the ions must be
zero. Ionic compounds are made up of a fixed proportion of positive and negative
ions. Consequently, ionic compounds can only be identified in terms of the
smallest unit of the compound, known as a formula unit, that would still have the
properties of the compound. In the case of sodium chloride, the sodium and chlo-
ride ions are present in a 1:1 ratio, as indicated by its chemical formula, NaCl.

The anions and cations in an ionic compound are locked in a regular struc-
ture, held by the balance of attractive bonds and electrical repulsion. The most
common model of ions shows them as spheres arranged in a regular three-
dimensional pattern called a crystal lattice (Figure 2, page 70). We can actually
see the shape of sodium chloride crystals—an observation that supports our
crystal lattice model. We often see similar structures in bridges or scaffolding
where struts are joined one to the other in a repeating pattern.

Not all crystal lattices are square, like that of sodium chloride. Depending on
the sizes and charges of the ions that make up the substance, the crystal lattice
varies in structure. All lattices are arranged so that each ion has the greatest pos-
sible number of oppositely charged ions close, while keeping ions with the same
charge as far away as possible. In all cases, each ion is surrounded by ions of
opposite charge. In theory, this arrangement of ions creates strong attractions.
This theory is supported by empirical evidence such as the hard surfaces and
high melting and boiling points of ionic solids.

70 Chapter 2

It requires a great deal of energy to break the strong electrostatic attractions
within a crystal lattice. The ions resist any movement, as even a slight shift would
cause positive ions to move closer to other positive ions, and negative ions closer
to other negative ions, resulting in strong repulsion. We can use this model to
explain why ionic substances are hard (the ions resist movement), and also why
they are often brittle. Once the lattice is broken, repulsions between ions of the
same charge will cause the substance to split into two crystals.

Finally, our model of the structure of ionic compounds can also explain the
electrical conductivity of their solutions. When ionic compounds are dissolved
in water, the positive and negative ions dissociate:

NaCl(s) → Na

(aq) + Cl

(aq)

The ions are responsible for carrying current when charged electrodes are
placed in the ionic solution.

The Formation of Ionic Compounds

We classify most simple compounds containing metallic elements as ionic.
Elements within a chemical family (group) tend to participate in similar chem-
ical reactions, producing ionic compounds with the same general formula. For
example, the metals in Groups 13 to 15, except mercury, will form ionic oxides
(compounds composed of a metal and oxygen) when burned in air. In the same
way, elements in Groups 1 and 2 form ionic compounds with oxygen: The oxides
formed by Group 1 elements have the general formula M2O while those of
Group 2 elements (e.g., magnesium oxide, MgO) have the general formula MO,
where M represents a metal ion. Because of its high melting point, magnesium
oxide is used to make objects that are exposed to very high temperatures, such as
crucibles, furnace linings, and thermal insulation.

From our discussion of trends in electronegativity, it makes sense that Group 1
metals readily react with the elements in Group 17 to form ionic compounds
with the general formula MX. These compounds, which are composed of a metal
and a halogen, are collectively referred to as ionic halides. Sodium chloride, an
example of an ionic halide, is found in large underground deposits in various
parts of the world. It is mined from these deposits and used as road salt, table salt,
and as a reactant in many industrial processes.

The elements in Group 2 show a similar trend, as they also react with the
halogens to produce ionic halides with the general formula MX2.

In general, the addition of a metal from Group 1 or Group 2 to water will
produce hydrogen gas and a basic ionic compound. Calcium hydroxide,
Ca(OH)2, is an example of an ionic compound that can be produced in this way.
However, the reaction of calcium and water is quite vigorous. A safer means of
producing this ionic compound is to react calcium oxide with water. Calcium
hydroxide is also referred to as slaked lime and is used to make mortar and
plaster for buildings.

Predicting Common Ions of Atoms

Noble gases are stable and virtually inert. Similarly, ions with eight valence elec-
trons appear to have a special stability. This arrangement of electrons is known
as a stable octet. To reach this stable state, metal atoms of elements in Groups 1,
2, and 3 will lose electrons to form cations, while elements in Groups 15, 16, and
17 will gain electrons to form anions. By looking at an element’s position in the
periodic table, we can predict the charge on that element’s most stable ion. For

ture of sodium chloride.

example, we can predict that a Group 1 element will tend to lose one electron,
becoming a cation with a charge of 1+. A Group 16 element, on the other hand,
will tend to gain two electrons to complete a stable octet, so it will form an anion
with a charge of 2–.

Hydrogen is a special case in that, theoretically, it can either give up an elec-
tron to form H+, which is equivalent to a proton, or gain an electron to form H�,
which has a filled shell like the noble gas helium.

Ions and the Human Body

Among the 12 elements that make up more than 99% of the human body (Table 1)
are five metals: calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and iron. These five
metals, which form positively charged ions in solution, are essential for main-
taining good health. For example, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ are major constituents of
blood plasma. Ca2+ is vital in the formation of bones and teeth. In addition to
positively charged ions, some elements that form negatively charged ions are also
essential for life. Chloride ions, Cl�, are another component of blood, and iodide
ions, I�, are required to prevent a condition called goitre, which results in the
enlargement of the thyroid gland.

Representing Ionic Bonds

We generally find it easier to grasp a new concept if we have a model or mental
image. An American chemist, G. N. Lewis, obviously thought the same thing, and
developed a model of the valence (bonding) electrons of single atoms or
monatomic ions. He represented his models on paper as electron dot diagrams,
or Lewis symbols. These symbols consist of the chemical symbol for the element
plus dots representing the number of valence electrons. For example, a sodium
atom would be represented as

The convention for indicating more electrons is as follows:

These diagrams can help us to represent the process of ion formation.
Electron dot diagrams also illustrate the theory that ionic bonds tend to pro-

duce full outer orbits of electrons: a configuration exactly the same as that of the
noble gases. Sodium has one valence electron. By transferring this electron to
another entity that has a stronger attraction for the electron, the resulting
sodium ion will have the same electron configuration as neon.

A chlorine atom has seven valence electrons. By attracting an electron from
another entity, the resulting chloride ion will have eight electrons in its valence
shell and the same number of electrons as its nearest noble gas, argon.

Representative elements around Groups 13 and 14 of the periodic table can
also achieve this special stability without losing or gaining electrons, as you will
discover later in the chapter.

Another way to describe the process of forming ionic compounds is to say
that electron transfers result from the large difference in electronegativity between
metals and nonmetals. Nonmetals have a strong tendency to gain electrons and
metals do not. When an atom of low electronegativity, such as a metal atom, and
an atom of high electronegativity, such as a nonmetal atom, are in proximity, one
or more electrons are transferred from the atom with low electronegativity, trans-
forming both atoms into ions. The metal ion will be positive and the nonmetal
ion will be negative. The resulting oppositely charged ions attract each other and
other ions, forming ionic bonds and resulting in a crystal lattice.

2.2

Using electron dot diagrams, we can show the formation of an ionic bond
between sodium and chlorine.

When illustrating the formation of an ionic bond, we place square brackets
around the ion to indicate that the charge is not associated with any particular
electron and that all the electrons in the valence shell are equivalent.

We can use the periodic table and electron dot diagrams to predict the for-
mulas of other ionic compounds. By finding out how many electrons they tend
to lose or gain to reach stable octets, we can figure out what ratio of ions will
make an electrically neutral compound.

As an example, suppose we were asked to draw electron dot diagrams to
illustrate the formation of calcium fluoride, state the ratio of ions in the com-
pound, and give the formula for the compound. Calcium is in Group 2, so will
form an ion with a charge of 2+. Fluorine is in Group 17, so will form an ion with
a charge of 1�.

To form an electrically neutral ionic compound, the ratio of calcium to fluoride
ions is 1:2. The formula is CaF2.

2.3 Covalent Bonding
Ionic compounds, as you have just learned, contain many ions arranged in a
three-dimensional structure. But not all compounds are brittle ionic solids with
high melting points. Some, such as paraffin wax, are solids at SATP but have rel-
atively low melting points. Others are liquids or gases, such as water and carbon
dioxide. In what way do these substances differ from ionic compounds? Can we
explain these differences with atomic theory? The answer is yes, but first we
should look at their formulas.

We have written the formulas of ionic compounds as simplest formula
ratios. The compound NaCl includes sodium and chloride ions in a 1:1 ratio. We
could build a crystal from 8 ions of each element, or 8 million of each and it
would form the same structure and would have the same properties. There is
only one ionic compound of sodium and chloride ions, and that compound
always contains a 1:1 ratio of the two ions.

This is not true of the bonding of nonmetals with each other. For example,
consider the simplest ratio formula CH. If carbon and hydrogen formed an ionic
compound with this ratio, we would expect that any structure in which these ele-
ments were in this ratio would have the same properties. However, this is not the
case. Using a mass spectrometer and combustion analysis we can demonstrate
that there are several compounds that have this simplest ratio formula. The gas
acetylene (ethyne), C2H2(g), and the liquid benzene, C6H6(l), both have the sim-
plest ratio formula CH, but they are otherwise much different in their physical
and chemical properties. Simplest ratio formulas indicate only the relative num-
bers of atoms in a molecular compound; they give no information about the
actual number of atoms or the arrangement of those atoms in a molecule. To dis-
tinguish among molecular compounds, we need to represent them with formulas
that describe the molecules that make them up.

Molecules can be classified by the number of atoms that they contain.
Molecules that contain only two atoms, such as carbon monoxide, CO, are called
diatomic molecules. If they contain more than two atoms, such as ammonia,
NH3, they are called polyatomic molecules.

Some elements also exist as molecules. Hydrogen and oxygen are examples
of elements composed of diatomic molecules. Sulfur, S8, and phosphorus, P4, are
polyatomic molecules.

Formation of Covalent Bonds

You already know that hydrogen can form a cation (H+) by losing a valence elec-
tron, or it can form an anion (H–) by gaining an electron and filling its electron
shell. However, two hydrogen atoms can each obtain a stable filled energy level
by sharing a pair of electrons. (Remember that the first energy level can only con-
tain two electrons.) The covalent bond that results arises from the simultaneous
attraction of two nuclei for a shared pair of electrons (Figure 1).

We can use the model of the Lewis symbol, or electron dot diagram, to com-
municate the theory of covalent bonding. When an electron dot diagram is used
to represent covalent bonding, we adapt it slightly and call it a Lewis structure
(because it illustrates the structure of the molecule). A Lewis structure shows the
valence electrons surrounding each of the component atoms as dots, with the
exception of the electrons that are shared: These shared electrons are represented
by a dash. In effect, this dash represents a covalent bond.

76 Chapter 2

According to the Lewis structure for a chlorine molecule, each Cl atom has
three pairs of electrons that are not involved in the formation of a covalent bond.
Each pair is referred to as a lone pair. There is one shared pair of electrons
between the atoms.

Many elements will form bonds that result in a full valence shell for each
atom, so that each atom has the electron structure of an atom of a noble gas
when the shared electrons are included. In other words, it has a stable octet. This
generalization is referred to as the octet rule. There are many exceptions to this
rule, but you will not be learning about these in this course.

Sample Problem 1

Draw Lewis symbols for the reaction of two bromine atoms and a Lewis struc-
ture for the resulting bromine molecule.

Solution

This method of representing molecules can be further simplified by not
indicating lone pairs. This representation is referred to as a structural formula.
The structural formula for chlorine would be Cl�Cl, and for bromine Br�Br. As
you can see, they are easier to write, and are quite similar to the chemical for-
mulas, Cl2 and Br2.

Each pair of shared electrons results in a single bond. Elements that need
only one more electron to complete their outer shell or energy level tend to form
single bonds. Hydrogen and chlorine are typical examples.

Elements in Group 16 are two electrons short of a full outer shell. How, then,
can they form covalent bonds with each other and still achieve a stable state? The
answer is simple, though not necessarily obvious: They form a double bond, with
each pair of atoms sharing two pairs of electrons between them. Oxygen and
carbon dioxide are examples of molecules that include double bonds. The double
bond is represented, in a Lewis structure and structural formula, as a double dash.

learned, shares three electron pairs, so it has a bonding capacity of three. What is
the bonding capacity of oxygen? It always shares two electron pairs, so has a
bonding capacity of two. It is easy to find the bonding capacity of any element by
looking at the Lewis structure of a molecule containing that element: The number
of dashes associated with the element is the same as the bonding capacity.

So far, we have looked at molecules of elements. Because the atoms are the
same, each has the same bonding capacity and each contributes the same
number of electrons to the covalent bond. The molecules of compounds, how-
ever, consist of atoms of two or more different elements, often with different
bonding capacities. How do we decide on their arrangement, when we draw
structural formulas? The central position in the arrangement is often occupied
by the element with the highest bonding capacity. Carbon and nitrogen, for
instance, are commonly at the centre of a structural formula. Electronegativity is
another means of deciding upon the central atom. When there is a choice of
atoms for the central position in the molecule, choose the least electronegative
element. Hydrogen is never the central atom since it can only form a single cova-
lent bond. Halides and oxygen are also usually not the central atom.

There are exceptions to these generalizations, but they meet our needs in
most cases.

Coordinate Covalent Bonds

Many substances contain a combination of covalent and ionic bonding. Consider
the compound ammonium chloride, NH4Cl. This white, crystalline solid dis-
solves rapidly in water and is an electrolyte—it dissociates to form a cation and
an anion. It has many of the properties of an ionic compound, but it is composed
only of nonmetals. We explain the properties of ammonium chloride by
describing it as an ionic compound composed of a chloride ion, Cl–, and a poly-
atomic ion, ammonium, NH4

+. The bond holding the chloride and ammonium
ions together is ionic, but the bonds within the polyatomic ammonium ion are
covalent. There are several polyatomic ions, including NH4

+, SO4
2– (sulphate),

and CO3
2–(carbonate), all of which are covalently bonded groups of atoms car-

rying an overall charge.
How does this arrangement fit with our description of covalent bonds?

Molecules that are composed of two or more different elements can sometimes
form covalent bonds where both of the electrons making up the bond are pro-
vided by the same atom. This type of bond is called a coordinate covalent bond.
Consider the formation of the ammonium ion from the regular covalent mole-
cule ammonia, NH3, and a hydrogen ion, H

+. The hydrogen ion does not bring
any electrons with it. To achieve a complete outer shell it can borrow two elec-
trons from the atom with which it bonds.

To explain this bond, we can draw Lewis structures. First, we must establish
the Lewis structure for ammonia. We can arrange the atoms with nitrogen
(which has the highest bonding capacity) at the centre, showing the five valence
electrons of nitrogen and the one valence electron of each of the three hydrogen
atoms.

We can show the pairs of shared electrons (covalent bonds) between adjacent
nitrogen and hydrogen atoms as dashes.

Notice the lone pair of electrons in this structure. A hydrogen ion, which has
no electrons of its own, can bond to the ammonia molecule by sharing this
unbonded pair of electrons. This is the coordinate covalent bond.

Once the hydrogen ion is bonded, there is no way to tell which of the hydro-
gens was the ion. Each of the four hydrogen atoms in the structure are equiva-
lent: The positive charge is not really associated with any particular hydrogen
atom. To indicate this, square brackets are placed around the entire ammonium
ion and the positive charge is written outside the bracket.

The Strength of Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds are strong. A large amount of energy is needed to separate the
atoms that make up molecules. For this reason, molecules tend to be stable at rel-
atively high temperatures: They do not easily decompose upon heating.

The stronger the bonds within the molecule, the greater the energy required
to separate them. The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the
number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Therefore, triple bonds are
stronger than double bonds, which are stronger than single bonds between the
same two atoms.

Drawing Lewis Structures and Structural
Formulas for Molecular Compounds

1. Arrange the symbols of the elements of the compound as you would
expect the atoms to be arranged in the compound. The element with the
highest bonding capacity is generally written in the central position
(Figure 2(a)).

2. Add up the number of valence electrons available in each of the atoms
(Figure 2(b)). If the structure is a polyatomic ion, add one electron for
each unit of negative charge, or subtract one for each unit of positive
charge.

3. Place one pair of electrons between each adjacent pair of elements
(forming single covalent bonds) (Figure 2(c)).

4. Place pairs of the remaining valence electrons as lone pairs on the periph-
eral atoms (not the central atom) (Figure 2(d)).

5. If octets are not complete, move lone pairs into bonding position between
those atoms and the central atom until all octets are complete
(Figure 2(e)).

6. If the peripheral atoms all have complete octets and there are pairs of elec-
trons remaining, place these electrons as lone pairs on the central atom.

7. Count the number of bonds between the central atom and the peripheral
atoms. If this number exceeds the bonding capacity of the central atom,
one or more of the bonds is coordinate covalent. To identify which ones,
try removing the peripheral atoms one at a time. If you can do this and
leave the central structure with complete octets, you have identified coordi-
nate covalent bonds (Figure 2(f)).

8. To give the structural formula, remove the dots representing the lone pairs
and replace bond dots with dashes (Figure 2(g)).

9. If you are representing a polyatomic ion, place brackets around the entire
structure and write the charge outside the brackets.

Explaining the Properties of Molecular Compounds

You are familiar with many molecular compounds: propane, C3H8(g), for the bar-
becue, water, H2O(l), in your bathtub, and sugar, C12H22O11(s), for your coffee. As
you can see, their physical properties vary greatly. In contrast to ionic com-
pounds, which are all solids at SATP, molecular compounds may be solids, liq-
uids, or gases (Table 2).

We have discussed the forces that bond atoms and ions together within a
compound, the intramolecular forces (“intra” means within). These are suffi-
cient to explain the existence of ionic and molecular compounds, and to explain
many of the properties of ionic compounds, but they aren’t sufficient to explain
the physical state of molecular compounds. Why is water a liquid at SATP and a
solid at STP? Why isn’t it a gas at all temperatures? Something, some force, must
hold the molecules together in the solid and liquid states.

Forces between molecules are called intermolecular forces (“inter” means
between). The evidence indicates that these forces are strong enough to cause
molecules to arrange themselves in an orderly fashion to form a lattice structure
(similar to that of ionic solids). Both solid water and solid carbon dioxide (dry
ice) show such structures when examined by crystallography (Figure 3).
However, intermolecular forces must be weak compared to covalent bonds. We
can deduce this from the observation that it is much easier to melt a molecular
solid than it is to cause the same substance to decompose. When water is heated
from –4°C to 104°C it changes state from a solid, to a liquid, and then to a gas,
but it does not decompose to oxygen and hydrogen. The energy added in the
form of heat is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces between the mol-
ecules, but not the covalent bonds between the atoms. Adding a relatively small
amount of heat will cause a solid molecular compound to change state from a
solid to a liquid, and then to a gas, but it takes much more energy to break the
covalent bonds between the atoms in the compound.

Later in this chapter, you will learn more about intermolecular forces and
how they affect the properties of substances.

2.4 Electronegativity, Polar Bonds,
and Polar Molecules

Why are some molecular substances solid, some liquid, and some gaseous at
SATP? Why do different liquids have different boiling points? Why can water
striders walk across the surface of a pond without falling in? Believe it or not, all
these phenomena depend on the bonds and forces between molecules.

Polar Covalent Bonds

So far, we have discussed models for two types of chemical bonding: ionic and
covalent. However, when a chemical bond is formed, it is not always exclusively
one or the other.

When electrons are shared between two atoms, a covalent bond results.
When the atoms are identical, such as in a chlorine molecule, the electrons are
shared equally (Figure 1(a)). However, this is not the case for a compound like
hydrogen chloride, where electrons are shared between two different elements. In

this situation, the sharing is unequal, as the bonding electrons spend more time
near one atom than near the other (Figure 1(b)). The electrons in the H–Cl
bond in a hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom
than near the hydrogen atom. This is because of chlorine’s greater attraction for
electrons. Due to this unequal sharing of electrons, the hydrogen atom is, on
average, slightly positively charged while the chlorine atom is slightly negatively
charged (Figure 2). We indicate these slight charges by d� and d�. (The Greek
letter delta, d, indicates “a small difference.”) While chlorine shows the greater
attraction for the bonding electrons, the attraction is not strong enough to actu-
ally bring about an electron transfer, as in an ionic compound. The bond is
somewhere between an ionic bond and a covalent bond and is called a polar
covalent bond.

We can predict which parts of the molecule will have d� and d� charges by
comparing the electronegativities of the atoms (given in the periodic table at the
end of this text). The most electronegative atoms will attract the electron pair
strongly, and so will tend to have a d� charge in the covalent compounds they
form.

Sample Problem 

(a) Draw the structural formula for methane (CH4, the main constituent
of natural gas).

(b) Indicate which atoms are slightly positive and which are slightly nega-
tive.

Solution

(a)

(b)

Each hydrogen atom carries a partial positive charge while the carbon atom car-
ries a partial negative charge.

To predict whether a chemical bond between two atoms will be ionic, polar
covalent, or covalent, we must consider the electronegativities of the elements
involved. The absolute value of the difference in electronegativities of two
bonded atoms provides a measure of the polarity in the bond: the greater the dif-
ference, the more polar the bond (Table 1). According to the periodic trends in
electronegativity described in Chapter 1, fluorine atoms have the greatest ten-
dency to gain or attract electrons and cesium atoms have the least. The difference
between their electronegativities is 3.3 (cesium 0.7 and fluorine 4.0). Since the
difference in electronegativity for cesium and fluorine is large, they should (and
do) form an ionic bond. In other words, the fluorine atom is strong enough, rel-
ative to the cesium atom, to “steal” a cesium electron.

84 Chapter 2

The difference in electronegativities of hydrogen (2.1) and chlorine (3.0) is
much less. They instead form a polar covalent bond. The greater the difference
in electronegativity, the more polar, and then more ionic, the bond becomes.
This relationship describes a continuum, a range from covalent to ionic, rather
than three different kinds of bonds (Figure 3). How do we know when to classify
a chemical bond as fully ionic? By convention, a difference in electronegativity
greater than 1.7 indicates an ionic bond. However, there are many binary com-
pounds in which the two atoms have an electronegativity difference of less than
1.7, but the compound still has ionic properties. For example, MgI2 (electroneg-
ativity difference 1.3) is an electrolyte, i.e., is an ionic compound.

Bonding Characteristics

Polar Molecules

Molecules of water, ammonia (a reactant in the production of nitrogen fertil-
izers), and sulfur dioxide (an industrial pollutant contributing to acid rain for-
mation) all have polar covalent bonds holding their atoms together. If a molecule
contains polar covalent bonds, the entire molecule may have a positive end and
a negative end, in which case it would be classified as a polar molecule. Not all
molecules containing polar covalent bonds are polar molecules, however.
Carbon tetrachloride, CCl4(l), contains four polar covalent bonds and HCl(g) has
one. However, HCl(g) is a polar molecule (Figure 4(a)), while CCl4(l) is not
(Figure 4(b)).

With practice you will be able to predict which molecules are likely to be

types of compounds tend to be polar molecules.

Intermolecular Forces

As mentioned earlier, the properties of molecular compounds cannot be
explained simply by covalent bonds. If covalent bonds were the only forces at
work, most molecular compounds would be gases, as there would be no attrac-
tion between the molecules strong enough to order the molecules into solids or
liquids. The concepts of the polar molecule and small charges on atoms help
explain why these molecular compounds are not all gases at SATP.

The existence of intermolecular forces was first suggested by Johannes van
der Waals, toward the end of the 19th century, to explain why gases liquefy when
they are cooled. Many different observations, such as surface tension and heat of
vaporization, provide evidence that there are three kinds of intermolecular
forces, each with different strengths. Two of these are classified as van der Waals
forces (in honour of Johannes van der Waals): dipole–dipole forces and London
dispersion forces. The third intermolecular force—hydrogen bonding—is gen-
erally not grouped with the other two.

Dipole–dipole forces are the forces of attraction between oppositely charged
ends of polar molecules (e.g., HCl). The positive end of each molecule attracts
the negative ends of neighbouring molecules—rather like a weak version of ionic
bonds. London dispersion forces, by contrast, exist between all molecules—both
polar and nonpolar—so are the only intermolecular forces acting between non-
polar molecules. Chemists believe that the weak attractive forces are the result of
temporary displacements of the electron “cloud” around the atoms in a mole-
cule, resulting in extremely short-lived dipoles. Because the dipoles last for only
tiny fractions of a second, the attraction is continually being lost, so the forces are
very weak. Dipole–dipole forces, when they exist, tend to be much stronger than
London dispersion forces. You will learn more about these forces later in this
course.

Hydrogen Bonds

Water, a polar molecule, consists of one atom of oxygen bound by single cova-
lent bonds to two hydrogen atoms. Its structure is simple, but water exhibits
some rather unusual properties: higher than expected melting and boiling
points, high vapour pressure, high surface tension, and the ability to dissolve a
large number of substances. To explain these properties, we must consider the
intermolecular forces that exist between water molecules. As a result of the large
difference in electronegativity between hydrogen and oxygen, the O–H bonds in
a molecule of water are highly polar covalent. The oxygen atom in a molecule of
water carries a slight negative charge while the hydrogen atoms carry a small pos-
itive charge (Figure 5). As a result, the hydrogen atoms of one water molecule
exert a strong force of attraction on the oxygen atom of neighbouring water mol-
ecules. This kind of intermolecular force is referred to as a hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen bonds occur among highly polar molecules containing F–H, O–H,
and N–H bonds. Although a hydrogen bond is similar to a dipole–dipole force,
it is stronger than any of the van der Waals forces.

Water molecules have a tendency to “stick together” because of hydrogen
bonding. This is one of the reasons why water appears to “climb” the sides of a
narrow tube (Figure 6). We can also explain water’s high melting and boiling
points using the concept of the hydrogen bond: Large amounts of energy are
required to break the hydrogen bonds in the solid and liquid states.

Most substances are more dense in the solid state than in the liquid state.
However, you have probably seen solid ice cubes floating in a glass of water. If
they float, they must be less dense than the liquid. Hydrogen bonds enable us to
explain this unusual behaviour: ice is less dense than liquid water because it
forms an open lattice structure when it freezes, with a great deal of empty space
between the molecules (Figure 7). This lower density of water in the solid state
enables aquatic life to survive the winter. Instead of freezing from the bottom up,
lakes freeze from the top down, creating an insulating layer of ice at the top. This
is one of the many reasons why scientists consider water to be indispensable for
the existence of life.

2.5 The Names and Formulas of
Compounds

Prior to the late 1700s, there was no systematic method of naming compounds.
Substances were named in a variety of ways. In some cases, the name referred to
the use of the compound; in other cases, it incorporated an obvious property, or
perhaps referred to the sources of the substance. These common names gave
little, if any, information about the composition of the compound.

The classical system of nomenclature based on the Latin names of elements
was devised in 1787 by French chemist Guyton de Morveau (1737–1816). As
more and more compounds were discovered, however, it became apparent that a
more comprehensive and consistent system of nomenclature was needed.

Today, we are aware of a very large number of compounds, and there is every
possibility that more will be discovered in the future. We need a system that is
easy to use and provides information on the composition of every compound. As
a result, scientists now use the system of chemical nomenclature chosen by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (sometimes just
called the IUPAC system) when naming compounds. Just as many immigrants to
Canada have learned a new language, you will soon become familiar with the lan-
guage of chemical nomenclature. Chemical nomenclature provides us with a sys-
tematic means of both naming and identifying compounds.

In describing a chemical compound, chemists may use its name or its for-
mula. The formula of an ionic compound tells us the ratio of elements present.
The formula of a molecular compound indicates the number of atoms of each
element present in a molecule of the compound. Every chemical compound has
a unique name. Knowing the names of common chemicals and being able to
write their formulas correctly are useful skills in chemistry. The common and
IUPAC names for some familiar compounds are shown in Table 1.

Binary Ionic Compounds

The simplest compounds are called binary compounds. Binary ionic compounds
consist of two types of monatomic ions (ions consisting of one charged atom).
In the formula of a binary ionic compound, the metal cation is always written
first, followed by the nonmetal anion. (This reflects the periodic table: metals to
the left, nonmetals to the right.) The name of the metal is stated in full and the
name of the nonmetal ion has an -ide suffix; for example, NaCl(s) is sodium chlo-
ride and LiBr(s) is lithium bromide. Binary ionic compounds can be made up of
more than two ions, providing they are of only two kinds: aluminum oxide is
Al2O3(s).

If we know what ions make up a compound, we can often predict the com-
pound’s formula. First, we determine the charges on each type of ion making up
the compound. The charge on an ion is sometimes called the valence. We then
balance the charges to determine the simplest ratio in which they combine. We
can predict the charge on the most common ion formed by each representative
element by counting the number of electrons that would have to be gained or lost
to obtain a stable octet. (Ionic charges for the most common ions of elements are
shown in the periodic table at the back of this text.) For example, the compound
magnesium chloride, a food additive used to control the colour of canned peas,
is composed of the ions Mg2+ and Cl–. For a net charge of zero, the ratio of mag-
nesium to chlorine ions must be 1:2. The formula for magnesium chloride is
therefore MgCl2(s).

Sample Problem 1

Predict the formula for magnesium oxide—a source of dietary magnesium when
used as a food additive.

Solution

Charge on magnesium ion: 2+
Charge on oxygen ion: 2–
The ratio of magnesium ions to oxide ions that produces a net charge of zero is 1:1.
The formula is therefore MgO.

You may be familiar with a method known as the crisscross rule for pre-
dicting the formula of an ionic compound. The crisscross rule works as follows:

1. Write the symbol of each of the elements in the order in which they appear
in the name of the compound.

2. Write the valence number (electrons lost or gained in forming that ele-
ment’s most stable ion) above the symbol of each of the elements.

3. Crisscross the numbers written above the symbols such that the valence
number of one element becomes a subscript on the other.

4. Divide each subscript by the highest common factor. The resulting sub-
scripts indicate the ratio of ions present in the compound.

5. Omit any subscript equal to 1 from the formula.

For example, if we were to use the crisscross rule to predict the formula of
magnesium chloride, we would go through these steps.

1. Write symbols in order:

Mg Cl

binary compound: a compound com-
posed of two kinds of atoms or two kinds of
monatomic ions

valence: the charge on an ion

2. Write valences above symbols:

3. Crisscross the valences, making them subscripts:

4. Divide subscripts by highest common factor (= 1):

Mg1 Cl2
5. Remove 1 subscripts:

MgCl2

Sample Problem 2

Solution

2 2

Ba S

Ba2 S2
The formula of barium sulfide is BaS.

Most transition metals and some representative metals can form more than
one kind of ion. Metals that can have more than one valence, or charge, are clas-
sified as multivalent. For example, iron can form an Fe2+ ion or an Fe3+ ion,
although Fe3+ is more common. The periodic table at the end of this text shows
the most common ion of each element first, with one alternative ion charge
below. It does not list all of the possible ions of the element.

Copper is a multivalent element. It is capable of bonding with chlorine in
two different ratios to form two different chloride compounds: CuCl and CuCl2.
How are the names of these compounds different? The IUPAC system of naming
compounds containing multivalent ions is very simple. The name of the metal
ion includes the charge on the ion, indicated by Roman numerals in brackets.
Consequently, CuCl(s) (in which copper has a charge of 1+) is copper(I) chloride,
and CuCl2(s) (in which copper has a charge of 2+) is copper(II) chloride. This
system of naming is sometimes referred to as the Stock system.

To determine the chemical name of a compound containing a multivalent metal
ion, we have to figure out the necessary charge on that ion to yield a net charge of zero.
If we are given the formula, we simply have to calculate the equivalent negative charge.
The metal’s charge is then written, in Roman numerals, after the name of the metal.
For example, if you were asked to name the compound MnO2, using IUPAC nomen-
clature, you would first look at the charge on the nonmetal ions. In this case, the charge
on each O is 2–, so the total negative charge is 4 –. The charge on the Mn ion must be
4+. Consequently, the IUPAC name for MnO2 is manganese(IV) oxide.

If the ion of a multivalent metal is not specified in a name, it is assumed that
the charge on the ion is the most common one.

than one possible valence

Sample Problem 3

The formula of a compound is found to be SnCl2. What is its IUPAC name?

Solution 

Charge on each Cl ion: 1–
Total negative charge is 2–
Charge on Sn ion: 2+
The IUPAC name for SnCl2 is tin(II) chloride.

Sample Problem 4

The formula of a compound is found to be Fe2O3. What is its IUPAC name?

Solution 

Total negative charge: 6–
Total positive charge: 6+
Charge on each Fe ion: 3+
The IUPAC name of Fe2O3 is iron(III) oxide.

The classical nomenclature system has, in the past, been used for naming
compounds containing multivalent metals with no more than two possible
charges. In this system, the Latin name for the element along with the suffix -ic
was applied to the larger charge, and the suffix -ous was applied to the smaller
charge. The compounds formed by copper and chlorine were therefore known as
cuprous chloride (CuCl(s)) and cupric chloride (CuCl2(s)).

In many industries, the classical system is still used extensively. Table 2 shows
a comparison of the classical and IUPAC names of multivalent metal ions.

Compounds with Polyatomic Ions

Many familiar compounds (such as sulfuric acid, H2SO4(aq), used in car batteries,
and sodium phosphate, Na3PO4(aq), a food additive typically found in processed
cheese) are composed of three different elements. Compounds of this type are
classified as tertiary compounds. (Many compounds containing polyatomic ions
consist of more than three different elements, but we will not be dealing with
these at this stage.) Tertiary ionic compounds are composed of a metal ion and
a polyatomic ion (a covalently bonded group of atoms, possessing a net charge).
We treat polyatomic ions much like regular monatomic ions when we write them
in formulas or chemical equations.

Polyatomic ions that include oxygen are called oxyanions. One example is
the nitrate ion, NO3

–. (Compounds involving the nitrate ion are often used in the
processing of foods, particularly cured meats, where they are often used to con-
trol colour. Potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate are added to foods to control
the growth of microorganisms.) In determining the name of a compound con-
taining an oxyanion, the first part of the name is easy: It is the name of the metal
cation. The second part requires more thought: We have to consider the three
parts of the ion indicated in Figure 1.

There are four polyatomic ions formed from combinations of chlorine and
oxygen. Note that all of these oxyanions have the same charge, despite the fact
that their formulas are different.

• ClO� is the hypochlorite ion;
• ClO2

– is the chlorite ion;
• ClO3

– is the chlorate ion; and
• ClO4

– is the perchlorate ion.

Note that in each name the stem is –chlor–. The suffixes and prefixes vary
according to the number of oxygen atoms in the ion, as described below.

• The per–ate oxyanion has one more oxygen atom than does the -ate
oxyanion.

• The -ite oxyanion has one fewer oxygen atom than does the -ate oxyanion.
• The hypo–ite oxyanion has one fewer oxygen atom than the -ite oxyanion.

Table 3 indicates some polyatomic ions commonly found in compounds.
You do not need to memorize each entry in this table. If you become familiar
with the -ate oxyanions, the most stable and common combination of nonmetal
and oxygen, then you need only remember the simple relationship between the
names of the ions.

The crisscross method can be applied to predict the formula of ionic com-
pounds involving polyatomic ions. From the ion charges (whether for a single

Solution 

CaCO3 is calcium carbonate.

Hydrates

Consumers are sometimes surprised to find a tiny white pouch when they open
the box containing a newly purchased pair of boots. What is it? What purpose
does it serve? The pouch contains a white, crystalline powdered desiccant (a
substance that absorbs water) called silica gel (SiO2(s)). The pouch keeps the air
inside the box dry so mildew and other moulds will not grow. Similarly
absorbent compounds are included in such diverse products as powdered foods,
talcum powder, and cat litter. Many tertiary ionic compounds form crystals that
contain molecules of water within the crystal structure. Such compounds are
referred to as hydrates. When heat is applied to a hydrate, it will decompose to
produce water vapour and an associated ionic compound, indicating that the
water is loosely held to the ionic compound. The water molecules are assumed
to be electrically neutral in the compound. When this water, called water of
hydration, is removed, the product is referred to as anhydrous. Bluestone,
hydrated copper(II) sulfate, is an example of a hydrate. Its formula is written
CuSO4·5 H2O(s). Notice how the chemical formula includes both the formula of
the compound and the formula for water. This is true of the chemical formulas
for all hydrated compounds. The formula for bluestone indicates the association
of five water molecules with each unit of copper(II) sulfate (Figure 2, page 96).
The IUPAC names for ionic hydrates indicate the number of water molecules by
a Greek prefix (Table 4, page 96), so bluestone, or CuSO4·5H2O(s), is called
copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate.

Naming Molecular Compounds

So far, in this section, we have been looking at the names and formulas of ionic
compounds. We now turn to molecular compounds, for which a different system
is used.

If a binary compound is formed from two nonmetals, it is classified as a molec-
ular compound. Even though there are fewer nonmetals than metals, there is a wide
variety of compounds formed from the combination of two nonmetals, because
two nonmetals may combine to form more than one compound. For example, N2O,
NO, and NO2 are three of the several binary compounds that can be formed from
nitrogen and oxygen. Each compound has different properties, and so different uses.

In naming compounds formed from two nonmetals, a Greek prefix is
attached to the name of each element in the binary compound indicating the
number of atoms of that element in the molecule. The common prefixes and
their numerical equivalences are shown in Table 5. If there is only one of the first
type of atom, we leave out the prefix “mono.”

Suppose you are asked to write the IUPAC name for the chemical compound
represented by the formula N2O. Looking at the first element, you can see that
the subscript after the nitrogen is two, so the prefix for nitrogen is “di.” Looking
at the second element, you can see that there is only one oxygen atom, so the
prefix for oxygen will be “mono.” Therefore, the formula’s IUPAC name is dini-
trogen monoxide.

Sample Problem 7

What is the IUPAC name for the chemical compound CF4?

Solution

C: carbon (not monocarbon)
F: tetrafluoride
The IUPAC name for CF4 is carbon tetrafluoride.

Once again, hydrogen is an exception to this rule: The common practice is
not to use the prefix system for hydrogen. For example, we do not call H2S dihy-
drogen sulfide, but simply hydrogen sulfide.

Naming Acids

You are already familiar with many acids and bases. You may have taken acetyl-
salicylic acid (also known as ASA, or Aspirin) to treat a headache, poured a little
acetic acid solution (vinegar) on your fish and chips, or used an ammonia solu-
tion to clean the smears from a mirror. You also know one of the tests for acids
and bases: acids turn blue litmus red, and bases turn red litmus blue. But you
might have been somewhat mystified about the naming of these substances.

Acids are well-known, long-established chemicals. They were originally  named
decades or even centuries ago, and the use of traditional names persists. The
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry suggests that names of acids
should be derived from the IUPAC name for the compound. According to this rule,
sulfuric acid would be called aqueous hydrogen sulfate. However, it is difficult to get
people to change to new names when the old, familiar names are so widely used.

Let us take, as a simple example, HCl(g). It is a binary compound formed
from a combination of hydrogen and a halogen. When a gas, it is named
hydrogen chloride. When it is dissolved in water, the resulting aqueous solution
displays a set of specific properties called acidic, and the name of the substance
changes. Binary acids are classically named by using the prefix hydro- with the
stem of the name of the most electronegative element and the ending -ic. The
name “hydrogen” does not appear. Instead, the word “acid” is added after the
hydro-stem-ic combination, as indicated in Table 6. Consequently, the classical
name for HCl(aq) is hydrochloric acid. Its IUPAC name is aqueous hydrogen
chloride. Similarly, HBr(aq) is hydrobromic acid or aqueous hydrogen bromide.

Note that the difference between the solution and the pure binary compound
is indicated by the presence or absence of the subscript (aq) in the formula.



Chemical Bonding 99

2.5

A second group of acids is named (by the classical system) in the same way as
binary acids. In this group, the IUPAC names for the polyatomic ions end in -ide
(e.g., the cyanide ion, CN–). Looking at Table 6, you can see that the classical
name for the acidic solution HCN(aq) will be hydrocyanic acid.

A third group of acids is formed from various combinations of oxyanions (neg-
ative polyatomic ions consisting of a nonmetal plus oxygen) with hydrogen. Perhaps
the best-known example is H2SO4(aq), or sulfuric acid, which is one of the most
widely produced industrial chemicals in the world. It is used to make pharmaceuti-
cals, detergents, and dyes, and is a component of car batteries. Phosphoric acid,
H3PO4(aq), is another example of an acid formed from an oxyanion and hydrogen.
Phosphoric acid is an ingredient in soft drinks, is a reagent in the manufacture of
fertilizers, and can be used as a rust remover. These acids are classified as oxyacids
because they incorporate oxyanions. Table 7 compares the classical name to the
IUPAC name for a series of acids derived from a chlorine-based oxyanion.

The classical names for oxyacids can be derived according to the simple rules
in Table 8.

When naming oxyacids, we omit the word hydrogen and add the word
“acid.” For example, to name the acidic solution with the formula HNO2(aq), we
would first consider the IUPAC name: hydrogen nitrite (from Table 3, or from
the Table of Polyatomic Ions in Appendix C). “Nitrite” changes to “nitrous,” we
drop the “hydrogen” from the front of the name, and add “acid” to the end. Thus,
HNO2(aq) is called nitrous acid.

Formula Classical name IUPAC name

HF(aq) hydrofluoric acid aqueous hydrogen fluoride

HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid aqueous hydrogen chloride

100 Chapter 2

If you were asked to write the formula for an acid, you would first have to
figure out the names of the ions involved, then their symbols or formulas, then
their ratio. For example, what is the formula for phosphoric acid? The -ic ending
indicates the presence of the -ate oxyanion of phosphorus: phosphate. The phos-
phate oxyanion is PO4

3– with a charge of 3–. The cation in oxyacids is always
hydrogen, which has a charge of 1+. To find the ratio of the ions, use the criss-
cross method:

1 3

H (PO4)
This gives the subscripts for each ion.

H3 (PO4)1
Divide each subscript by the highest common factor—in this case, 1:

H3 (PO4)1
The hydrogen ions and the phosphate oxyanions will combine in a ratio of 3:1.
Therefore, the correct formula is H3PO4(aq).

Sample Problem 8

What is the formula for the oxyacid sulfurous acid?

Solution

sulfurous indicates sulfite ion: SO3

1 2

H2 (SO3)1
The formula for sulfurous acid is H2SO3(aq).

Sample Problem 9

Solution

hypochlorous indicates one fewer oxygen atom than a chlorite ion: ClO–

1 1

H1 (ClO)1
The formula for hypochlorous acid is HClO(aq).

Naming Bases

Chemists have discovered that all aqueous solutions of ionic hydroxides are
bases. (You will learn more about bases in Chapter 8.) Other solutions have also
been classified as bases, but for the time being we will restrict our exploration of
bases to aqueous ionic hydroxides such as NaOH(aq) and Ba(OH)2(aq). Notice
that these bases are formed of a combination of a metal cation with one or more
hydroxide anions. The name of the base is the name of the ionic hydroxide: in
this case, aqueous sodium hydroxide and aqueous barium hydroxide.

Chemical Reactions
Plastics, synthetic fabrics, pharmaceuticals, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, all
of which are very much a part of modern society, are each produced as a result
of our knowledge and understanding of chemical reactions. These products
illustrate the value of chemicals and the reactions that produce them. However,
chemical reactions also have the potential to produce hazardous substances. On
July 9, 1997, 400 t (4.00 × 105 kg) of plastic caught fire at a plastics manufacturing
site in Hamilton, Ontario (Figure 1). The fire raged for more than three days,
engulfing parts of Hamilton in thick black smoke. As a result of the fire, many
people were exposed to hydrochloric acid, benzene, and other such potentially
hazardous compounds. The Hamilton fire was an example of chemical reactions
allowed to proceed in an uncontrolled fashion.

The fire was also an example of the release of energy that accompanies many
chemical reactions. Energy, whether produced or absorbed, is an important
aspect of chemical reactions. When fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, gasoline,
and diesel fuel are burned, energy is released in the form of heat. Combustion
converts chemical energy to thermal energy, which allows us to drive cars, fly air-
planes, and heat our homes. Not all chemical reactions produce energy. Some,
including photosynthesis, require energy. Photosynthesis is perhaps the most
important chemical reaction on Earth. In green plants, energy from the Sun is
used to convert carbon dioxide and water into starch and oxygen. This process
converts light energy to chemical energy and is largely responsible for the main-
tenance of life on Earth.

The reactions in the Hamilton fire were obviously bad for people and the envi-
ronment. We work to avoid such catastrophes. The consequences of other reactions
require a more balanced approach. Environmental problems such as acid rain and
the greenhouse effect have been linked to the products of everyday combustion
reactions, the ones that keep us warm and mobile. Although resolving such issues
involves more than an understanding of science concepts, we will be in a better
position to decide how to act if we understand chemical reactions.

In this chapter, you will be

able to

• show that you understand the
relationship between various
types of chemical reactions and
the nature of the reactants;

• use both the periodic table and
experimentation to predict the
reactivity of a series of elements
and compare the reactivity of
metals and alloys;

• predict the products of various
types of reactions, write chemical
equations to represent the reac-
tions, and test your predictions
experimentally, demonstrating
safe handling of chemicals; 

• identify chemical compounds and
reactions in everyday use or of
environmental significance.

However, if you put solid lead in an iron(III) nitrate solution, the fol-
lowing reaction does not occur:

3 Pb(s) + 2 Fe(NO3)3(aq) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 Pb(NO3)2(aq)
Why do some reactions occur, but others do not?

All around us, and even inside us, substances are combining to produce
new substances. Sometimes the products are useful, and other times
not so useful. Sometimes they may even be very hazardous. For
instance, common household bleach can react with acidic toilet bowl
cleaners to produce poisonous chlorine gas.

In some reactions, the change is almost undetectable. Other reac-
tions produce a visible product, a colour change, or a temperature
change. In this activity, you will observe what happens when an ordinary

3.1 Recognizing and Understanding 
Chemical Changes 

With the ever-growing number of motor vehicles on our roads, gasoline is in
greater demand today than ever before. When gasoline is burned at high tem-
perature in the engine of a motor vehicle, a chemical change occurs that releases
large volumes of gases and a considerable amount of heat, which together drive
the movement of the engine’s pistons. The exhaust gases also cause considerable
environmental problems (Figure 1).

How do you know whether the change you are observing is a chemical
change or a physical change? The heat and gases produced by burning gasoline
are only two of the indicators of a chemical change. In general, there are several
clues that can help us classify change as either chemical or physical (Table 1).
However, we cannot always rely upon simple observation to distinguish between
a physical and a chemical change, as both physical and chemical changes often
involve changes in state and energy. For example, when gasoline evaporates (a
physical change) it absorbs heat from its surroundings. As you can see, both the
physical change and the chemical change involve energy flows.

On a cold winter day, the hot gases produced by combustion engines become
easily visible as the water vapour in the exhaust condenses as it cools (Figure 2).
However, the products of a chemical reaction are not always easily detected. In
some cases, we may have to perform a chemical analysis (perform diagnostic
tests) to confirm that a new substance has been produced (Figure 3).

So far, we have discussed only qualitative observations of chemical change.
Can we use quantitative measurements to obtain more evidence? Quantitative

chemical change: any change in which a
new substance is formed

Photochemical smog—a form of air pollution
caused by the action of sunlight on other pol-
lutants—is a major problem in large cities
where there are many vehicles.

of heat an endothermic reaction and released in an exothermic reaction.

On a winter morning, we can see that some
kind of gas is produced by car engines. Is this
sufficient evidence of a chemical change?



Chemical Reactions 109

evidence could include measurements of mass, temperature, and volume.
Unfortunately, such measurements are not always diagnostic. Consider mass and
the combustion of gasoline. At first glance it may appear that mass has disap-
peared when gasoline burns. However, if we are careful to collect all the products
and measure their mass we would find that the total mass of the products is the
same as the total mass of the reactants. In chemical changes, the total mass of
matter present before the change is always the same as the total mass present after
the change, no matter how different the new substances appear. This evidence,
compiled from many careful measurements, supports the atomic theory of
matter. If we think of a chemical change as a rearrangement of particles at the
molecular level, then it is simple to argue that the mass must be constant. The
individual particles do not change, except in the ways they are associated with
each other. Any model that we use to represent chemical reactions must follow
the law of conservation of mass.

A Mechanism for Chemical Change

You might recall the kinetic molecular theory from previous grades, when you
used it to explain changes of state and physical change. The central idea of this
theory is that the smallest particles of a substance are in continuous motion. As
they move about, they collide with each other and with objects in their path. Very
tiny objects, such as specks of carbon in car exhaust, are buffeted by these parti-
cles, and move about erratically (Figure 4). A temperature increase indicates that
these particles are moving more quickly. We can make use of the kinetic molec-
ular theory as we search for a better understanding of chemical change.

You have applied the kinetic molecular theory to examples of physical change.
For example, it can explain why the smell of spilled gasoline is so strong near a
filling station. When a substance absorbs heat from its surroundings, the particles
in the substance (in this example, the molecules in the spilled gasoline) gain energy
and move more rapidly. Some of the faster-moving molecules in the spill will leave
the surface of the spilled liquid—evaporate—so they can be detected by our noses.

Octane, C8H18(l), one of the components of gasoline, is a highly volatile
liquid at room temperature. Liquid octane does not react with oxygen. However,
at higher temperatures, gaseous octane will react with oxygen to form gaseous
carbon dioxide and water vapour. Can we use kinetic molecular theory to explain
this chemical change? We can, in a combination of kinetic molecular theory and
atomic theory known as the collision–reaction theory.

Figure 3

In the presence of oxygen, a glowing splint
will ignite and burn brightly. This is a qualita-
tive diagnostic test for oxygen.

kinetic molecular theory: a theory
stating that all matter is made up of particles
in continuous random motion; temperature is a
measure of the average speed of the particles.

collision–reaction theory: a theory
stating that chemical reactions involve colli-
sions and rearrangements of atoms or groups
of atoms, and that the outcome of collisions
depends on the energy and orientation of the
collisions

Figure 4

The erratic motion of tiny particles was first
observed and described by Robert Brown in
1827. You can view each motion with a flash-
light and a heterogeneous mixture.

Particles in liquids and gases are always in motion. Usually we cannot
see this motion, because the particles are very small. Here is a way to
see the kinetic molecular theory in action.

The KMT in Action



110 Chapter 3

According to kinetic molecular theory, the motion of all particles results in
random collisions. At room temperature, the colliding molecules of octane and
oxygen simply bounce off one another unchanged. However, at higher tempera-
tures, the molecules collide at greater speeds, and therefore with greater energy.
Atomic theory suggests that in such a collision, the repulsive forces of the elec-
trons in the two molecules could be overcome. In some collisions, the valence
shells of the reactants will overlap. When this occurs, their electrons can be
rearranged to form new bonds.

Collisions do not always result in a chemical change. The orientation (relative
positions) of the reactants is important. In the case of burning octane, the carbon
and hydrogen atoms in the octane must be oriented in such a way that the atoms
in the colliding oxygen molecule can form C�O and H�O bonds simultaneously.

The burning of another common fuel, methane, CH4(g), can be explained in the
same way. When methane is burned in a laboratory burner, the reactants (methane
and oxygen molecules) collide with enough energy and at the proper orientation for
successful rearrangements to occur. As a result, new substances are formed: gaseous
carbon dioxide and water vapour. The rearrangement of atoms that has occurred
(Figure 5) happens in only a tiny percentage of all the collisions; however, there is
an enormous number of collisions and the reaction takes place rapidly.

reactants: the substances that combine in
a chemical reaction

Figure 5

Collision–reaction theory suggests that parti-
cles of methane and oxygen must collide with
the correct orientation and at sufficient speed
to react. However, chemists do not yet fully
understand the mechanism of even this rela-
tively simple reaction. The process may go
through as many as 100 intermediate steps!

In this activity, you will simulate the motion and behaviour of reactants
in a chemical reaction. The reactants are represented by different
coloured Ping-Pong balls with Velcro affixed on one side (Figure 6).

4. According to the collision-reaction theory, what are the requirements
for a chemical reaction to take place?

Representing Chemical Change

We have looked at the evidence for a chemical reaction taking place, and the
mechanism by which it has taken place. The next piece of the puzzle is devel-
oping a way to represent exactly what happens during the chemical change: what
the reactants are and what they change into.

Over the years, chemists have developed two formats that effectively com-
municate information about chemical reactions: the word equation, in which
only the chemical names of the reactants and products are shown, and the chem-
ical equation, in which the proportions of reactants and products are shown by
writing coefficients in front of the chemical symbols for each substance.

The word equation for the combustion of octane reads

octane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water

The reactants are written on the left of the arrow; the products are written
on the right. In every equation, an arrow is used to take the place of the word
“yields” or “produces.”

The chemical equation for this reaction conveys much more information:

2 C8H18(g) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)

The symbols tell us the precise composition of each substance. Placing coef-
ficients in front of each symbol tells us the amount of each substance, or how
many molecules (in ionic substances, formula units) of each substance are
involved. In our combustion example, 2 molecules of octane and 25 molecules of
oxygen react to produce 16 molecules of carbon dioxide and 18 molecules of
water. Finally, the subscript letters tell us the state of each reactant and product
(all gases in this reaction).

A method for writing balanced chemical equations is developed in Unit 2.

word equation: a representation of a
chemical reaction using only the names of
the chemicals involved

chemical equation: a representation of
a chemical reaction that indicates the chem-
ical formulas, relative number of entities, and
states of matter of the reactants and products

coefficient: a whole number indicating the
ratio of molecules or formula units of each
substance involved in a chemical reaction

In this activity, you will build structural models to represent three chemical reac-
tions: methane, CH4(g), combines with oxygen, O2(g), to produce carbon dioxide,
CO2(g), and water, H2O(g); water is dissociated to produce hydrogen, H2(g), and
oxygen, O2(g); carbon, C(s), combines with oxygen, O2(g), to produce carbon
dioxide, CO2(g).

(b) Which law are you following by balancing the equations?

Catalysts and Collisions

In an internal-combustion engine more reactions take place than just the
oxygen–octane reaction described earlier. The reason is that there are many more
than just two substances in the engine. Some of these substances are present in
gasoline (such as benzene and various other carbon compounds, and some
sulfur and other impurities) and some are present in air (such as nitrogen). As a
result of these additional reactions and incomplete combustion of the fuel,
exhaust gases contain several products other than carbon dioxide and water,
including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons.
Many cars today are equipped with catalytic converters to decrease the quantity
of pollutants released when gasoline is burned. The metals platinum and palla-
dium and nickel oxide can be used as catalysts in a converter. A catalyst is a sub-
stance that speeds up a chemical reaction, but is still present at the end of the
reaction. Catalysts do participate in reactions; they are consumed and regener-
ated as the reaction proceeds. For this reason catalysts appear as neither product
nor reactant in chemical equations. Instead, the catalyst involved (in this case
nodules of platinum and palladium) is written above the arrow. Using this con-
vention, we can represent the conversion of carbon monoxide to less harmful
carbon dioxide in a catalytic converter:

Pt/Pd

2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g)

catalytic converter: a device that uses
catalysts to convert pollutant molecules in
vehicle exhaust to less harmful molecules

catalyst: a substance that speeds up the
rate of a reaction without undergoing perma-
nent change itself

Lead Poisoning

The platinum and palladium in catalytic con-
verters are “poisoned” and become ineffec-
tive if they are exposed to lead. This is one
factor that encouraged the Canadian govern-
ment to ban the use of leaded gasoline.

Some have elements as reactants and compounds as products; some the reverse.
Some produce huge amounts of heat; some absorb heat. Some take place only in
aqueous solution; some will take place whenever the reactants come in contact
with each other. How can we make sense of such a variety?

Once again, we analyze evidence obtained from many chemical reactions
and look for patterns. For generations, chemists have been doing this, and have
provided a basis upon which we can classify chemical reactions. While there are
exceptions, most reactions can be classified as one of the types listed in Table 1.

Combustion Reactions

Every time we flick a lighter, strike a match, fire up the barbecue, or stoke a camp-
fire we are starting a combustion reaction. It is, of course, more commonly
known as burning, and is easily identified because of its most useful feature: the
production of heat. For combustion to proceed, three things must be present:
fuel, oxygen, and heat.

In a complete combustion reaction, a reactant burns with oxygen to produce
the most common oxides of the elements making up the substance that is
burned. For example, gasoline often contains trace amounts of elemental sulfur.
When the gas is burned, the sulfur combines with oxygen to produce sulfur
dioxide.

S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)

To successfully predict the products of a complete combustion reaction, we
must know the most common oxides (Table 2). For metals, the most common
oxide is the one formed with the metal’s most common ion.

Rain is normally slightly acidic due to the presence of carbon dioxide, which
dissolves in atmospheric moisture and reacts to form very dilute carbonic acid,
H2CO3(aq). Nitrogen oxides from lightning strikes and plant decay, and sulfur
oxides from volcanic eruptions also contribute to the natural acidity of rain,
forming nitric and sulfuric acid, respectively, in reactions with atmospheric
water. However, human intervention has considerably increased the quantities of
oxides being released into the atmosphere. Our everyday activities involve a great
many combustion reactions, from riding buses to heating our homes. Gaseous
oxides of nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide) and sulfur (e.g.,
sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide) are released from sources such as automobiles and
coal-burning power plants. These oxides join the naturally produced oxides in
the atmosphere, react with water vapour to form acids, and are responsible for
the increased acidity of precipitation known as acid rain.

When a substance burns, we call the process a combustion reaction. The gener-
alization for a complete combustion reaction is that the substance reacts with air
to produce light and heat, and the most common oxides of the elements present.
The purpose of this investigation is to test the ability of this generalization to
predict the products of a combustion reaction.

This investigation involves the combustion of a sample of butane under an
Erlenmeyer flask. Complete a lab report, including the Prediction, Analysis, and
Evaluation.

Question

What are the products of the combustion of butane?

Prediction

A sample of butane in a disposable plastic lighter is burned under an Erlenmeyer
flask filled with air. In addition to direct observations, diagnostic tests for water
(using cobalt chloride paper) and carbon dioxide gas (using limewater) are con-
ducted before and after the reaction.

Combustion and the Atmosphere

Carbon dioxide and water are products of the combustion of carbon com-
pounds, including fossil fuels and wood in forest fires. These gases are also
released in volcanic eruptions and by living organisms during cellular respira-
tion. All of these sources have been present for billions of years, to greater or
lesser degree, and have had a significant effect on the atmosphere, including
making it warmer than it would otherwise be. Scientists have proposed a theory
to explain the effect of carbon dioxide and water vapour on the average temper-
ature on Earth, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Visible sunlight
is able to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth’s surface, where much
of it is absorbed. The heated surface emits infrared radiation (heat) into the
atmosphere. However, atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapour absorb
some of this outgoing infrared radiation and then re-emit it randomly in all
directions, including back toward Earth. This has the effect of preventing some
of the heat from escaping, thereby further heating the air and Earth’s surface.

Our increased burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, in furnaces, and in indus-
trial processes over the past century is widely blamed for the increasing concen-
tration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Average global temperatures have also
been on the rise. Many (but not all) scientists are convinced that these two obser-
vations are linked: that the artificial increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is like an extra blanket on the bed, causing the temperature to
rise. Continued emission of carbon dioxide at the same rate may lead to con-
tinued global warming and dramatic climate changes. You will find out more
about the greenhouse effect in Chapter 11.

2. List the most common oxides of carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen,
and iron.

3. Describe at least two environmental issues related to combustion
reactions.

Synthesis Reactions

The ionic compound sodium bromide is, as you know, made up of the elements
sodium and bromine. These two elements are sometimes combined in the lab to
produce sodium bromide. When sodium metal is added to a container of
bromine liquid, the reaction is quite spectacular (Figure 3).

Ammonia is an important industrial product. It is prepared by combining
nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas in what is referred to as the Haber process. This
process was initially developed in Germany as a step in the manufacture of explo-
sives, but is now used around the world to produce agricultural fertilizer.

Each of these reactions is referrred to as a synthesis reaction (sometimes
also called a combination reaction). In a synthesis reaction, two or more sub-
stances combine to form a single product. The compound formed by a synthesis
reaction can be either ionic or molecular. Synthesis reactions can be represented
by the general equation

A + B → AB

Several synthesis reactions are associated with the combustion of gasoline,
and the vehicle exhaust. For example, the burning of gasoline at high temperature
causes nitrogen in the air to react with oxygen to produce nitrogen monoxide.

nitrogen + oxygen → nitrogen monoxide
N2(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO(g)

In cases where the reactants are elements, it is easy to recognize the reaction
as a synthesis reaction. After all, two elements reacting together can only form a
compound. However, a reaction in which one or both of the reactants is a com-
pound can still be a synthesis reaction. For example, when gasoline is burned in
air, the nitrogen monoxide produced can further react with oxygen to produce
nitrogen dioxide.

nitrogen monoxide + oxygen → nitrogen dioxide

Pt

2 NO(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO2(g)

Sample Problem 1

Sulfur trioxide is a byproduct of the combustion of gasoline in car engines. In the
atmosphere it reacts with condensed water on dust particles, producing sulfuric
acid. Write a word equation and a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

Solution

sulfur trioxide + water → sulfuric acid
SO3(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO4(aq)

tion is taking place?

Chemical Reactions 119

3.2

As you know, photosynthesis is an important chemical reaction for life on
Earth. In photosynthesis, energy from the Sun is used to convert carbon dioxide
and water to glucose and oxygen.

sunlight/chlorophyll

6 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l)→ C6H12O6(aq) + 6 O2(g)

From the chemical equation for photosynthesis, it is apparent that a complex
compound (glucose) is synthesized from simpler compounds (carbon dioxide
and water). In this regard, one might be tempted to classify the reaction as a syn-
thesis reaction. However, oxygen is also formed. Therefore, despite its name, we
cannot classify photosynthesis as a true synthesis reaction. Photosynthesis is an
important exception to the classification of chemical reactions that we are dis-
cussing in this chapter.

Decomposition Reactions

In some urban areas, during periods of warm, dry weather, nitrogen dioxide
(from industrial processes and vehicle exhaust) can accumulate in the atmos-
phere, forming a brownish haze.

Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can cause NO2 to decompose to NO and
O, in what is referred to as a decomposition reaction. The oxygen atom, O, pro-
duced by this reaction is very reactive. It can combine with other chemicals to
cause serious health effects, including breathing disorders.

Decomposition reactions can be represented by this general equation:

AB → A + B

In this type of reaction, a compound decomposes to form two or more sub-
stances. The products could be elements or compounds, depending on the nature
of the reactants. Decomposition reactions of simple binary compounds generally
yield, as products, the two elements that make up the compound. In earlier times,
decomposition reactions were used by chemists to discover the chemical formulas
of substances. Today, decomposition reactions are the basis for industrial produc-
tion of many elements from naturally available compounds. For example, the
electrolysis of molten sodium chloride will yield liquid sodium and chlorine gas.
This is an important method for the production of the element sodium.

sodium chloride → sodium + chlorine

2 NaCl(l)→ 2 Na(l) + Cl2(g)

The decomposition of water produces oxygen and hydrogen (Figure 4).

120 Chapter 3

Compounds consisting of more than two elements often decompose to form
simpler compounds. For example, when a hydrated salt is heated, the products
are the anhydrous salt and water.

copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate → copper(II) sulfate + water
CuSO4•5 H2O(s) → CuSO4(s) + 5 H2O(g)

Sample Problem 2

The high-temperature combustion of gasoline in an engine produces a serious
air pollutant, nitrogen monoxide. The platinum/palladium catalytic converter
built into today’s automobiles catalyzes the decomposition of nitrogen monoxide
into harmless nitrogen and oxygen. Write a word equation and a balanced chem-
ical equation to represent this reaction.

Solution

nitrogen monoxide → nitrogen  +  oxygen

Pt/Pd

2 NO(g) → N2(g) +  O2(g)

When a compound decomposes as a result of heating, we call it a thermal
decomposition reaction. Many carbonates and hydrogen carbonates undergo
thermal decomposition. For example, sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda
or sodium bicarbonate) will decompose when heated to produce sodium car-
bonate, water, and carbon dioxide in the following reaction:

2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2

Clearly, this is not a case of a binary compound splitting into two elements.
Rather, the sodium hydrogen carbonate has split into three simpler compounds
upon decomposing. The more complex the reactant, the more difficult it
becomes to predict the products of the reaction, but the production of an oxide
and water is a common result of decomposition. The thermal decompositions of
carbonic acid and calcium hydroxide illustrate this generalization:

H2CO3(aq) → CO2(g) + H2O(g)
Ca(OH)2(s) → CaO(s) + H2O(l)

Sample Problem 3

Zinc carbonate undergoes thermal decomposition to produce zinc oxide and
carbon dioxide. Represent this reaction in a word equation and a balanced chem-
ical equation.

Solution

zinc carbonate → zinc oxide  + carbon dioxide

ZnCO3(s) → ZnO(s) + CO2(g)

3.3 Single Displacement Reactions
Most metals occur naturally as ores—metal-containing minerals. To isolate silver
from its ore, it is sometimes first reacted with a solution of cyanide, to form
aqueous silver cyanide, which is then reacted with another metal, such as zinc.

This type of reaction is referred to as a single displacement reaction. Single dis-

The examples above and many others show us that, in single displacement reac-
tions, a metal will sometimes displace another metal from an ionic compound,
while a nonmetal will sometimes displace another nonmetal. But which elements
displace which other elements? Is there a pattern? Using empirical evidence gath-
ered in many experiments, scientists have been able to list the elements in order
of their reactivity. Separate ordered lists, activity series, have been produced for
metals and nonmetals.

Whether or not one element displaces another element in a compound depends on
the relative reactivities of the two elements. The more reactive element will replace
the less reactive element. The purpose of this investigation is to develop your own
activity series of metals, much as was done many years ago. You will test two ele-
ments at a time (one as an element and one as a compound in solution), to find
out which displaces which from a compound, and, therefore, which is more reac-
tive. Because elements generally have low solubility, you will be able to tell when
one element is displacing another by the formation of a precipitate. A colour
change in the solution may also provide clues that a reaction has taken place.

You will have available six metals and six solutions of aqueous ionic com-
pounds to build your activity series using the techniques learned in Investigation

Single Displacement Reactions and the Activity Series

An activity series of metals appears in Figure 3. It consists of a list of metallic ele-
ments arranged in order of decreasing reactivity. Whether or not a single dis-
placement reaction will proceed can usually (but not always) be predicted by
referring to the activity series. Each metal element will displace a metal ion that
appears below it in the series.

We can predict, by looking at Figure 3, that there are several metals that will
displace hydrogen from its compounds with nonmetals, including water and
acids. Experimental evidence supports this prediction. Magnesium, aluminum,
zinc, iron, nickel, tin, and lead will all react with aqueous solutions of acids, dis-
placing hydrogen. The very reactive elements (potassium, barium, calcium,

In the activity series of metals, each metal will
displace any metal listed below it. This series
is based on experiments like Investigation
3.3.2. Other series, using different criteria,
may be slightly different. Hydrogen is usually
included in activity series, even though it is
not a metal, because hydrogen can form posi-
tive ions, just like the metals.

skin and eyes. Wear eye pro-

sodium, and lithium) will react vigorously with water and acids at room tem-
perature to produce hydrogen gas. The other product of these reactions with
water is an aqueous solution that contains hydroxides (strong bases). Since these
reactions are violent and dangerous, this is not the procedure used to manufac-
ture the metal hydroxides of these elements. Rather, they are prepared by reacting
the metal oxide with water.

Copper, silver, and gold do not react with acids or water. This evidence sup-
ports their placement below hydrogen in the activity series.

The concept of electronegativity was created to help predict properties of
elements like the activity series of the metals. For the metals, the lower the elec-
tronegativity, the more reactive the metal should be. As you can see (Table 1)
electronegativity works reasonably well in predicting the activity series, with
some exceptions.

Sample Problem 1

In welding operations, aluminum is reacted with iron oxide in what is called the
Thermite process. Use the activity series to predict the products of this reaction
and represent the reaction in a balanced chemical equation.

Solution

According to the activity series, aluminum is more reactive than iron and will
displace it from iron oxide. The reaction will produce iron and aluminum oxide:

2 Al(s) + Fe2O3(s) → 2 Fe(s) + Al2O3(s)

Sample Problem 2

Use the activity series to predict whether zinc reacts with magnesium nitrate and,
if so, the products of this reaction. Represent the reaction in a balanced chemical
equation.

Solution

Zinc is listed below magnesium in the activity series so it will not displace mag-
nesium from the compound magnesium nitrate. Therefore the reaction will not
take place.

Zn(s) + Mg(NO3)2(aq) → NR

Note that NR is written in place of the products in the reaction in Sample
Problem 2, indicating No Reaction—zinc and magnesium nitrate do not react.

The halogens also have their own activity series (Figure 4). A halogen will be
displaced from a compound by a halogen listed above it in this activity series. We
might predict this sequence based on the concept of electronegativity. As you
move down the group of halogens, electronegativity decreases. Iodine is the least
reactive halogen and fluorine is the most reactive in this group.

Trends in reactivity within the same period are also evident among the non-
metals. Electronegativity increases as you move from left to right within the same
period, and the nonmetals show a general tendency to increase in reactivity as
you move in the same direction across a period.

Extracting Metals

As a result of their greater reactivity, many of the metals listed above hydrogen in
the activity series are most commonly found in compounds, ores, rather than as
elements. Many can be mined from the Earth’s crust. The most common types of
metal ores are oxides, sulfides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and silicates.

Copper is sometimes found relatively pure as an element, but usually it is
mined as carbonate or oxide ores. These ores are treated with dilute sulfuric acid
to leach the copper out as a copper(II) sulfate solution. This solution is then
reacted with iron. Since iron is higher in the activity series than copper, the iron
will displace the copper from the solution to yield solid copper and a solution of
iron(II) sulfate.

Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)

According to the activity series, silver and gold are among the least reactive
elements, so they would tend to be displaced from any compound by almost any
other metal, leaving the precious metals as elements in the Earth’s crust. This is
largely the case—gold is often found as small pieces of elemental metal (nuggets)
inside rock. As gold-containing ore is eroded by wind and rain, small pieces of
gold break free and are washed into nearby streams and rivers. During the Yukon
gold rush of 1897–1898, thousands of people, hoping to make their fortunes,
panned for gold in the riverbeds close to where the metal had previously been
discovered (Figure 5).

Rock that contains eight grams of gold per tonne of rock is considered good
ore, so larger-scale methods of extracting gold from ore involve processing huge
masses of rock. The older method involved mixing crushed ore with mercury,
which formed an alloy (mercury alloys are often called amalgams) with the gold
that was separated from the remaining rock. This amalgam was then heated to
remove the mercury (which would be reused), leaving “gold sponge.” A more
modern method of gold extraction involves grinding the ore, mixing it with lime,
reacting the mixture with cyanide (to encourage the gold to ionize), adsorbing
the gold onto carbon, and washing off the gold with superheated water.

Similar processes can be used to recover silver from its native ore.
Not surprisingly, there are environmental concerns with both of these

methods of extracting precious metals: mercury and cyanide are both extremely
toxic; the volumes of ore that are subjected to these procedures result in huge
open-pit mines and large heaps of leftover tailings; and nearby rivers and streams
can be damaged by the chemical and particulate runoff from the mines.

Figure 5

The gold-panners’ technique was simple,
requiring only a shallow pan. The gold pan-
ners placed sand from the riverbed in the pan
with some water, then swirled the pan so
that the water gradually washed away the
lighter sand. Heavier flecks and nuggets of
gold were left behind.

Hi-Tech Role for an Ancient Metal

Because of its lack of reactivity and high con-
ductivity, gold is used for coating the elec-
trical contacts on computer memory chips.
There is an industry growing up around the
recycling of computer parts, to reclaim the
gold and other valuable components.

8. The activity series plays an important role in many mining processes,
especially when metals are extracted from their ores. Elements that
are high in the activity series, such as calcium and sodium, are never
extracted from compounds in an aqueous environment. Provide a
possible explanation for this.

you decide on changes that could be made in the way we use the
metal or the way we obtain it. Report on your findings.

Corrosion and Protection

The protection of metals against corrosion also has its basis in the activity series.
Corrosion, which can result in the destruction of metal products, is a costly
problem. The most common form of corrosion occurs when metals react with
atmospheric oxygen in the presence of moisture. The rusting of iron, forming
hydrated iron(III) oxide, is a familiar example of this process. The rust is slightly
soluble, and fairly soft, so tends to flake away, leaving more iron exposed to the
air and ready to rust further. To reduce this problem, a thin layer of a less reac-
tive metal is sometimes plated onto iron to form a barrier between the iron and
the air. For example, a welder might use a welding rod consisting of low-carbon
steel (an alloy of iron with a small amount of carbon) plated with a thin layer of
copper (Figure 6). Copper is listed below iron in the activity series, so is less likely
than iron to corrode.

Another means of preventing corrosion is galvanizing, in which iron is
coated with another element. This time, however, a more reactive metal—zinc —
is used to coat the iron. The zinc reacts quickly with oxygen to form hard, insol-
uble zinc oxide. This oxide protects the iron beneath by forming a barrier
between the iron and the air. Galvanized iron nails are often used in the con-
struction industry. Galvanized iron is also found in water tanks, roofs, and chain-
link fences (Figure 7). Eventually, rusting may still occur as erosion of the zinc
oxide slowly leads to the exposure of the iron.

Finally, iron can be made resistant to corrosion by combining it with small
amounts of other metals to form stainless steel, an alloy. In addition to iron,
stainless steel contains carbon and metals such as chromium. The carbon
increases the hardness of the iron (allowing it, for example, to take and hold a
sharp edge). Chromium is added to increase iron’s resistance to corrosion.
Alloying iron with chromium decreases the reactivity of iron.

Alloys

Alloys consist of metals (and sometimes other substances, such as carbon) that
have been mixed while the principal metals are in liquid phase and then cooled
to the solid state. They are, therefore, solid solutions. Alloys often have charac-
teristics different from the “parent” metals. They are almost exclusively made to
address a certain technological demand—one that could not be met by the prop-
erties of a single pure metal. For example, pure aluminum is very light, making
it a popular material for the engines and bodies of vehicles and aircraft. However,
in its pure form it is also rather weak. When small amounts of other metals are
added, it becomes much stronger while remaining relatively light. Consequently,
parts used in the construction of vehicles and aircraft are often made of alu-
minum alloys. The most common aluminum alloys contain metals such as
copper, magnesium, and manganese. These alloys are also used to make the cans
for carbonated beverages, bicycle frames, and the siding on homes. Because alu-
minum is a very useful material, and expensive to produce from ore, there is a
strong market for recycled aluminum. It is one of the materials that is collected
by many of Ontario’s blue-box household-recycling programs.

When designing a plant that extracts ionic compounds from seawater, the engi-
neers must select materials that will not be damaged by the seawater, which is
quite corrosive. To help in the choice of an appropriate material for pipes, an
engineer investigated the corrosion resistance of various metal alloys in seawater.

There are, of course, different costs associated with different types of metal:
Mild steel, cast iron, and steel coated with cement are relatively inexpensive
options. Higher-cost choices are copper-based alloys and stainless steel. These
costs would have to be considered when recommending an appropriate material.
Higher-diameter pipes (which could be used to reduce the velocity of the sea-
water flowing through them while delivering the same amount of material) cost
more than low-diameter pipes because more material is needed to make them.

Familiar Alloys

You are probably most familiar with stainless steel in the kitchen. Chopping
knives, cutlery, pans, cutting blades in the food processor—all are made of stain-
less steel. Steel is ideal for these uses: It is rigid and strong, keeps a sharp edge,
does not react with the acids in food, and does not react with oxygen in the air
(it won’t rust if you leave it wet in a drying rack).

Gold is a soft metal. In pure form, a fine gold chain would stretch and break
under stress. In the manufacture of fine gold jewellery, metals such as silver, copper,
and zinc can be added to gold to form alloys harder than pure gold, but with a sim-
ilar appearance. In North America, the karat system is used to indicate the purity
of gold. When jewellery is manufactured it is stamped with a number followed by
the letter K (meaning “parts per 24”) (Figure 8). An object stamped 24K is 100%
gold, but such objects are extremely rare—they would scratch and deform easily.
Fine jewellery is often manufactured in 18K (75% pure) gold, which is harder and
so more practical. 14K (58.3% pure) and 10K (41.7% pure) gold are even harder.

The compositions of some common alloys are shown in Table 4.
The reasons for the special properties of alloys are very complicated, but have

to do with the bonding among the elements within the solution. Pure metals are
malleable because the atoms are, in effect, floating in a sea of free electrons. When
other elements are added, the bonds change, electrons become locked in place,
and the entire structure becomes much more rigid. This accounts for the hardness
of stainless steel, for example, and its ability to keep a sharp edge (Figure 9).

Careers in metallurgy involve the study and use of properties and characteristics
of metals. There are many different employment opportunities associated with
metallurgy, involving planning, design, and development of machinery and
methods to extract, refine, and process metals and alloys. Many metallurgical
processes involve chemical reactions such as single displacement reactions.

Careers in Metallurgy

Metallurgical Engineer

This is a specialized branch of materials engineering. Metallurgical engineers work in a
variety of areas, from processes and methods for extracting metals from ore and mineral
resources, to the study of metals and alloys in useful products. 

Corrosion Engineer

A corrosion engineer might focus on ships,
bridges, car bodies, or household appliances.
The main task involves designing ways to
reduce corrosion with paints, other coatings,
or by restricting electrical contact with other
materials. Research, communication, and
teamwork skills are also important.

3.4 Double Displacement Reactions
Magnesium chloride, a soluble ionic compound, occurs naturally in seawater. In
the large-scale commercial preparation of magnesium, calcium hydroxide is
added to large quantities of seawater, resulting in the production of a white
powder, magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2:

MgCl2(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) → Mg(OH)2(s) + CaCl2(aq)

The reaction used to extract magnesium from seawater is known as a double
displacement reaction. This type of reaction involves two reactants recombining
to form two new compounds (Figure 1). We can write a generalization for such
reactions:

AB + CD → AD + CB

The reaction involves two ionic compounds as reactants. As the equation
above shows, the ions “change partners” to form the products. This type of reac-
tion commonly occurs in aqueous solutions. In order to predict products of
single and double displacement reactions, you need to understand the nature of
solutions and learn a method of determining whether a substance dissolves in
water to an appreciable extent.

Solubility

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute and a solvent. Every solute has
its own solubility in a given solvent. You will learn more about solubility in Unit
3, but it can be simply described as the maximum quantity of a solute that will
dissolve in a solvent at a given temperature and pressure. For example, if you add
salt (sodium chloride) repeatedly to water, stirring after each addition, the salt
will dissolve until the salt solution reaches its maximum concentration. After this
point, any salt you add will simply remain in the solid state and settle to the
bottom of the container.

We can take advantage of the individual solubilities of different substances
in water. If the product of a reaction is very soluble, it will stay in solution, so we
assign it the subscript (aq). However, if the product is only slightly soluble, effec-
tively insoluble, it is likely that more will be produced than can dissolve. If the
product is a solid, it will be visible as a precipitate and will be assigned the sub-
script (s) (Figure 2). If it is a gas, it will appear as bubbles and be given the sub-
script (g).

Sometimes an experimenter wants to know whether the ions of a certain ele-
ment are present in a solution. A quick way of testing is to try to make the ions
react with another substance to form a product that is only slightly soluble. The

solid will precipitate out and become visible. But how do we know which sub-
stances are likely to have high solubilities, and which low solubilities? A solubility
table outlines the solubilities of a large number of ionic compounds (Table 1).
You can use this table, or the table in Appendix C, to predict whether an ionic
compound, formed as the product of a chemical reaction in solution, is likely to
form a solid precipitate (i.e., have low solubility) or remain in solution (i.e., have
high solubility). You find the solubility of a compound by looking up the anion
first, then finding the cation in the body of the table, and following across to the
left, to read the solubility.

Suppose a technician has to test the water in a stream for a variety of sub-
stances, including sulfates. The planned test would produce calcium sulfate,
CaSO4. What is the solubility of CaSO4? Would calcium sulfate, if it forms, pre-
cipitate out? To solve this problem, we can refer to the solubility table (Table 1,
and in Appendix C). Looking at the top rows of the table, we can locate the
column containing the anion SO4

2–. We then look in the two boxes below this
anion to find out whether the sulfate containing the cation Ca2+ has high solu-
bility or low solubility. The table tells us its solubility is low, and so it will tend to
precipitate out of any solution in which it is present.

If we had checked for the solubility of copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4, we would
discover it belongs in “most” category for the sulfate anion: high solubility.
Copper(II) sulfate would tend to stay dissolved in any aqueous solution in which
it forms.

Ontario. A firework containing a carefully measured quantity of potassium
nitrate accidentally falls into the lake. Will the potassium nitrate dissolve to any

All nitrates have high solubility. A significant amount of the potassium nitrate is
likely to dissolve.

Types of Double Displacement Reactions

There are three clues that tell us that a reaction is proceeding: if a precipitate is
formed, if a gas is produced, or if the solution becomes more neutral.

Precipitation Reactions

When separate aqueous solutions of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate are
mixed together, calcium carbonate and sodium chloride are produced.

CaCl2(aq) + Na2CO3(aq) → CaCO3(s) + 2 NaCl(aq)
(dissolved) (dissolved) (solid precipitate) (dissolved)

As a result of its low solubility, the calcium carbonate formed by the reaction
appears as a solid. Sodium chloride, a highly soluble compound, will remain in
solution. Many double displacement reactions will form products that have low
solubility. If one of the products has low solubility, it may form a precipitate.
Precipitates can be removed from a solution by filtration (Figure 3).

To predict whether a precipitate might form from a double displacement
reaction, we need to identify the ionic compounds that will be formed by the
reaction and determine whether they will be soluble or insoluble. This informa-
tion can be obtained from the solubility table (Table 1 and in Appendix C).
Recall that insoluble substances produced in the reaction will be visible as a pre-
cipitate, while soluble products will remain in solution.

Write a balanced equation to represent the reaction of an aqueous solution of
barium chloride with an aqueous solution of potassium sulfate. Indicate the
physical state of the reactants and products involved.

Solution

BaCl2(aq) + K2SO4(aq) → 2 KCl(aq) + BaSO4(s)

Reactions Producing a Gas

Some double displacement reactions result in a gas product. For example, sodium
sulfide solution and hydrochloric acid react to produce hydrogen sulfide gas:

Na2S(aq) + 2 HCl(aq) → 2 NaCl(aq) + H2S(g)

Neutralization Reactions

Finally, an acid can react with a base in a third type of double displacement reac-
tion, sometimes referred to as a neutralization reaction. (You will learn more
about acids and bases in Chapter 8.) In a neutralization reaction, the products
formed are neither acidic nor basic. They are typically water and an ionic com-
pound (referred to as a “salt”). The reaction between magnesium hydroxide and
hydrochloric acid is an example of this type of double displacement reaction:

Mg(OH)2(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + 2 H2O(l)

You may have an aqueous suspension of magnesium hydroxide in your med-
icine cabinet at home. It is more commonly known as the antacid “milk of mag-
nesia.” The above reaction explains how milk of magnesia relieves acid
indigestion by neutralizing excess stomach acid.

Predicting Double Displacement Reactions

Double displacement reactions are likely to proceed if

• one of the products is a precipitate;
• one of the products is a gas; or
• the reactants are an acid and a base, and the result is a neutralization 

reaction producing a salt and water.

When double displacement reactions occur among ions in solution, the products
often include one of the following: water, a precipitate, or a gas. The formation
of a precipitate, or the evolution of a gas, along with the nature of the reactants,
provide evidence that a double displacement reaction has occurred.

The purpose of this investigation is to use the generalizations you have
learned about double displacement reactions and solubilities to predict the prod-
ucts of a reaction. Complete the Prediction, Experimental Design, Analysis,
Evaluation, and Synthesis sections of the investigation report.

SUMMARY

placement reaction between an acid and a

Analytical chemists often make use of the potential for precipitate formation in
double displacement reactions to determine the presence of a particular chemical
in a sample. This type of analysis is referred to as a qualitative analysis, as only the
identity of the chemical is determined, not the amount of chemical present.

In this investigation, you will use the solubility table (Table 1, page 137, or in
Appendix C), along with experimental techniques learned in Investigation 3.4.1,
to identify an unknown solution as containing either silver nitrate or calcium

New Elements
Elements such as carbon, sulfur, copper, iron, and gold were known to ancient
civilizations. However, most of the remaining elements have been discovered
since the early part of the 18th century. The end of the 20th century witnessed
the discovery of transition metals with atomic numbers 110, 111, 112, 114, 116,
and 118. The International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry has assigned
temporary names and symbols to newly discovered elements (Table 1).

Elements 110, 111, and 112 (Figure 1) were identified between 1994 and 1996
by an international research team working in Germany. Ununquadium (114) was
synthesized in Dubna, Russia, in 1998, and both ununhexium and ununoctium
(116 and 118) in California, U.S.A., in 1999. The elements are all extremely
unstable and short-lived, rapidly decomposing to form other, lighter elements.

Imagine that you are a member of an international research group attempting
to produce or identify the undiscovered elements with atomic numbers 117 and
119. Your task is to write a two-part research paper. In the first part of your paper,
you will propose names and symbols for each of the elements, and predict

(a) their atomic structures,

(b) their physical and chemical properties, and

(c) the compounds that they would form.

This part of your paper should include a rationale for your predictions com-
plete with chemical nomenclature, structural formulae, and chemical equations
as required to support the rationale.

Ununbium was synthesized in an experiment
involving the fusion of a zinc atom with a
lead atom. Fusion of the atoms was accom-
plished by repeatedly accelerating a zinc
atom toward a lead target, finally generating
the specific velocity required for the reaction.
At the time of its discovery in 1996, it was
considered to be the heaviest atom produced.
An atom of ununbium consists of 112 pro-
tons, 112 electrons, and 165 neutrons. The
electrons are arranged in seven energy
levels. The seventh energy level is occupied
by two valence electrons.

“As a biochemist and molecular biologist, my work

involves human identification using recombinant DNA

(deoxyribonucleic acid). We use robotic workstations to

do most of the manual processing steps, such as dilu-

tion and working with chemical reagents. The DNA

itself is carefully extracted from biological samples in a

very clean area to eliminate problems from contamina-

tion. In the future, as the technology moves forward,

we expect to see more of the chemistry and biology of

the process performed on biochips or silicon wafers.

DNA has been called the silent witness, since it is

often left indiscriminately at the

crime scene. The ability to find and

extract minute quantities of DNA

from biological samples has

helped solve numerous crimes

and exonerated the innocent. The

quest is to gain more information

from smaller samples in the most

efficient manner possible. I like

challenges. In forensic science we

have the best of both worlds—that

constant challenge, combined with

the satisfaction of seeing the

direct benefit of our research

efforts.”

Quantities in Chemical
Formulas
When you read the list of ingredients on a package of cereal, do you also notice
how much of each ingredient is contained in a serving? We can compare the
quantities of sugar or fat or the percentage of daily requirements of vitamins and
minerals in different brands (Figure 1). This quantitative information helps us
decide which product to select to suit our needs.

Quantities in chemical formulas offer similar important information about
the composition and properties of compounds. For example, water (H2O(l)) and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2(l)) both contain the same types of atoms. The only dif-
ference is in the number of oxygen atoms. This difference, which appears small,
actually results in significant differences in the properties of the two compounds.

Water is very stable, can be stored safely for indefinite periods, and can be
used for drinking and washing. It is an important ingredient of living cells and is
essential for all life on Earth. Hydrogen peroxide, on the other hand, is so
unstable that it must be stored in darkened containers to slow its decomposition.
Concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide must be used with caution,
because the chemical reacts readily with other substances and will cause blis-
tering of the skin on contact. Because hydrogen peroxide is toxic it is used to kill
bacteria—in low concentrations (0.03%) it is used as an antiseptic to treat minor
cuts and abrasions. At higher concentrations (6%) it is used to bleach hair, pulp
and paper, and synthetic and natural fibres. At even higher concentrations, its
bactericidal properties can be applied as part of the treatment of waste water. At
sufficiently high concentrations it is explosive.

How can we determine the chemical composition of a substance? Identifying
the substance’s properties is one method. In this chapter, you will learn other
methods to do this. You will also learn how to measure and communicate quan-
tities when dealing with entities as small as atoms, ions, and molecules.

In this chapter, you will be

able to

• explain the law of definite propor-
tions and the significance of dif-
ferent proportions of elements in
compounds;

• explain the relationship between
isotopic abundance and relative
atomic mass;

• describe and explain Avogadro’s
constant, the mole concept, and
the relationship between the mole
and molar mass;

• determine empirical and molec-
ular formulas using percentage
composition obtained from given
data and through experimenta-
tion;

• develop technological skills for
quantitative analysis;

• solve problems involving quanti-
ties in moles, numbers of parti-
cles, and mass numbers.

160 Chapter 4

4.1 Proportions in Compounds
In January 1998, nearly double the average annual total of freezing rain fell in
one week in eastern Ontario and Quebec, creating the worst ice storm in decades:
Ice Storm ’98 (Figure 1). A study undertaken by the Ontario Ministry of Health
to determine effects associated with the ice storm revealed a striking rise in
carbon monoxide poisoning. The most common sources of poisoning were gas-
powered generators and barbecues inappropriately used indoors, in locations
such as basements and garages.

The chemical formula for carbon monoxide, CO, is similar to that for carbon
dioxide, CO2 (Figure 2). The difference in the number of oxygen atoms per mol-
ecule, however, is responsible for the very different properties of the two gases
(Table 1).

Carbon Monoxide

We cannot sense carbon monoxide gas, just as we cannot sense carbon dioxide
when we exhale. Both are colourless and odourless gases at room temperature
and pressure. However, carbon monoxide is much deadlier than carbon dioxide.
Carbon oxides are produced whenever fossil fuels are burned. Carbon atoms
combine with oxygen atoms to form compounds of carbon and oxygen. When
the supply of oxygen is plentiful, each carbon atom bonds with two atoms of
oxygen to form carbon dioxide. But when the supply of oxygen is low, each
carbon atom bonds with only one atom of oxygen, forming carbon monoxide.

The deadly effects of carbon monoxide are due to its effect on the blood’s
ability to carry oxygen to body tissues and vital organs such as the heart and
brain (Table 2). Carbon monoxide competes with oxygen when binding to

hemoglobin. It binds to hemoglobin so readily that the number of oxygen mol-
ecules that are able to bind is drastically reduced. When oxygen molecules cannot
be transported by the hemoglobin to all the cells of the body, the cells are
deprived of the oxygen needed for cellular respiration, resulting in cell death,
tissue damage, and organ failure (Figure 3).

Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide is normally present in our atmosphere and is harmless at low
concentrations. It is essential to the growth of green plants and so is essential to
all life on Earth. When food molecules are broken down in a cell in a human
body, carbon dioxide is produced and is carried away from the body tissues by
the bloodstream, to be exhaled (Figure 4). Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide does not bind to hemoglobin, but it takes on an interesting and impor-
tant role: its chemical properties enable it to control the acidity of the blood, pre-
venting sudden life-threatening fluctuations in the pH level.

Many everyday applications make use of some of the physical and chemical
properties of CO2. Solid CO2 is used in refrigeration as dry ice. Gaseous CO2 can
be dissolved in water under pressure to form carbonated beverages, which release
bubbles of the gas when the pressure drops. Carbon dioxide is denser than air
and does not support combustion. Because of this property, the foam in some
fire extinguishers contains CO2; this blankets the fire, thereby starving the fire of
oxygen. This property can also be extremely hazardous: at high concentrations,
there is a danger of suffocation if the thickness of the layer of CO2(g) is too great
and one cannot escape for air.

Practice

Understanding Concepts

1. In a table, list the similarities and the differences between the 
compounds carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Include physical
and chemical properties and the information derived from their
chemical formulas. 

2. Explain why carbon monoxide exerts a toxic effect in the body.

3. Carbon dioxide has many useful applications in everyday products.
Choose two products, and explain the physical and chemical 
properties of carbon dioxide that are applicable in each.

The Law of Definite Proportions

The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide comparison illustrates that not only
do the properties of substances depend on the elements they are composed of
but also on the quantities of each element as well. If we decomposed the same
mass of each gas, we would get carbon and oxygen from each, but the masses of
each element collected would be different. Conversely, if we were to synthesize
each of these gases, they would both require carbon and oxygen but would
require different amounts of each element. The composition of a compound is
constant, regardless of how it was synthesized. Indeed, carbon would always
combine in the same proportions with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide,
whether the carbon burned is charcoal or diamond. Recall from the activity at
the beginning of this chapter that Cu2+(aq) ions and CO3

2�
(aq) ions always combined

in a 1:1 ratio, even when there was an excess of one of the ions.

Figure 3

Inhaled cigarette smoke contains about 400
parts per million (ppm) of CO. Because of the
effect of CO on the blood’s ability to transport
oxygen, the heart is forced to work harder to
supply enough oxygen to body tissues. This
may result in increased incidence of heart
disease and heart attacks.

Figure 4

If an unknown gas is bubbled through a lime-
water solution and the mixture becomes
cloudy, then the gas most likely contains CO2.
The limewater diagnostic test provides 
evidence for CO2 in the breath you exhale.



162 Chapter 4

These observations are summarized in the law of definite proportions, first
stated by Joseph Proust (1734–1794):

A specific compound always contains the same elements in definite propor-
tions by mass.

Proust was one of the first scientists to apply quantitative analysis to chem-
ical reactions. He and others started an area of study known as stoichiometry.
This word is derived from the Greek words stoikheion, meaning “element,” and
metron, meaning “measure.” Stoichiometry is the study of the relationships
between the quantities of reactants and products involved in chemical reactions,
important knowledge in the application of chemistry in many fields, such as
industry, medicine, and ecology.

can be determined by testing minute sam-
ples, and, from the ink formulation, the man-

first made available can be traced. In cases
where several entries in a document were

4.2 Relative Atomic Mass and
Isotopic Abundance

When you look at the periodic table, you can find the value of atomic mass for
each element. How is this value useful? Beginning with the mass of atoms, we can
calculate the mass of larger numbers of atoms and molecules and predict the
mass of reactants and products for any chemical reaction. The values for atomic
mass are important information if we are to use our knowledge of chemistry in
practical applications.

How were these atomic masses determined, and why are most of the atomic
mass values in the periodic table not whole numbers? The concept of deter-
mining atomic masses was, in fact, initially based on the law of definite propor-
tions. In the early 19th century, John Dalton proposed that atoms of different
elements had different masses and that all atoms of the same element had the
same mass. At the time, there was no method of determining the actual mass of
an atom. Based on what they did know, however (that elements always combine
in the same proportions when they form compounds), chemists were able to
determine the masses of elements that reacted with each other. By comparing
these masses, Dalton devised a system of assigning relative atomic masses to the
known elements. To do this, Dalton assigned an atomic mass to atoms of a par-
ticular element, and then determined the atomic masses of atoms of other ele-
ments relative to the first element.

The concept of relative mass is not uncommon. When we refer to the mass
of any object on Earth, we are comparing the mass of that object to the mass of
a reference, or standard, mass. In fact, there exists a whole bureau, the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in France, whose purpose is to
ensure worldwide uniformity of measurements. The bureau houses, among
other things, the international standard mass for one kilogram. The National
Research Council of Canada houses our standard mass for the kilogram (see
Figure 1).

Relative atomic mass is the mass of each element needed to react with a
fixed mass of the element chosen to be the standard, currently carbon-12. When
Dalton prepared his first table of relative atomic masses, he assigned an atomic
mass of 1 to hydrogen, the lightest element known. He then determined the mass

of other elements that reacted with a fixed mass of hydrogen. Since formulas of
compounds were not known, errors were made in assigning relative mass. For
example, when water was analyzed, it was found that 1 g of hydrogen combines
with 8 g of oxygen, leading to oxygen being incorrectly assigned a relative atomic
mass of 8. At the time, Dalton did not know that, in fact, two atoms of hydrogen
had combined with each atom of oxygen, and that the relative atomic mass of
oxygen should be 16.

Later, oxygen was chosen as the standard and was assigned an atomic mass
of 16. Other elements were then assigned relative atomic masses according to the
mass needed to react with a fixed mass of oxygen. For example, experimental
evidence shows that 24 g of magnesium atoms are needed to react with 16 g of
oxygen atoms. Similarly, 40 g of calcium atoms are needed to react with 16 g of
oxygen atoms. Therefore, if we assign a relative atomic mass of 16 to oxygen, the
relative atomic mass of magnesium would be 24, and the relative atomic mass of
calcium would be 40. All other elements can be assigned relative atomic masses
in a similar way. Sixteen was chosen as the relative atomic mass for oxygen
because that gives the lightest element, hydrogen, a relative atomic mass of 1.

In 1961, the scientific community accepted the modern scale of relative
atomic mass based on carbon, more specifically, the carbon-12 (C-12) isotope.
There are two reasons for choosing C-12 as the standard. First, carbon is a very
common element that is available to scientists everywhere. Second, and more
important, by assigning a value of 12 to C-12, the atomic masses of nearly all the
other elements are very close to whole numbers, with the lightest atom having a
mass of very close to 1.

One atomic mass unit (SI symbol, u) is defined as exactly 1/12 the mass of
a C-12 atom. In other words, one atom of C-12 is defined as having a mass of
12.0 u. Although the mass of 1 u was not known when the atomic mass scale was
first developed, it has since been determined experimentally:

1 u = 1.660 540 2 � 10–27 kg

This IUPAC and SI convention is now used by scientists worldwide and is an
example of the international cooperation between scientists that makes it pos-
sible for them to communicate effectively with one another.

Isotopic Abundance

We have noted that the atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 the mass of a C-12
atom. The reason for this detailed description is that there are several isotopes of
carbon, each with a different mass. The C-12 atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons,
and the C-13 atom has 6 protons and 7 neutrons; as a result, their mass is dif-
ferent. Any sample of carbon will contain atoms of both isotopes. The existence
of isotopes explains why most elements have atomic masses that are not whole
numbers.

For most elements, the isotopic composition of any given sample is constant.
Any sample of naturally occurring carbon has the same percentage of the two
non-radioactive isotopes of carbon, C-12 and C-13. Because of this constant iso-
topic composition, we can use an average value for the atomic mass of carbon,
taking into account the percentage of each isotope in a typical sample. The per-
centage of an isotope in a sample of an element is called its isotopic abundance.
Naturally occurring samples of carbon consist of 98.89% C-12 and 1.11% C-13.
Measurements show the atomic mass of carbon atoms to be 12.01 u, rather than
the 12.00 u that would be expected if all carbon atoms were of the C-12 isotope.
When we use the isotopic abundance of each isotope in the carbon sample to cal-
culate the atomic mass, we obtain a value very close to the measured value of
12.01 u. Let’s see how the calculation is done.

Our carbon sample has a mixture of atoms of different mass, C-12 and C-13.
Since atoms cannot be divided into fractional parts, we consider a large number
of them in our calculation to avoid calculating fractions of atoms. Let’s assume
we have 10 000 atoms. To obtain an average mass (Figure 2) for the mixture of
atoms (mav), we need to find the total mass (mtot),and then divide by the number
of atoms.

98.89%, or 9889 atoms, are C-12

1.11%, or 111 atoms, are C-13

mC-12 = 9889 atoms × 12 u

= 118 668 u

mC-13 = 111 atoms × 13 u

= 1443 u

Avogadro’s Constant and the Mole

You are already familiar with some terms used to define convenient numbers
(Table 1). For example, a dozen is a convenient number referring to items such
as eggs or doughnuts. The number used by chemists to define numbers of enti-
ties as small as atoms is the mole (SI symbol, mol). Twelve eggs or doughnuts
make a dozen, but how many atoms, molecules, or ions make a mole? Modern
methods of estimating this number of entities have led to the value
6.02 × 1023 entities/mol. This value is called Avogadro’s constant (SI symbol
NA), named after the Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856), who
researched the idea (although an Austrian scientist, J. J. Loschmidt, is credited
with determining the first reasonable estimate of the number). A mole is the
amount of substance containing 6.02 × 1023 of anything, just as a dozen is the
amount of substance containing 12 of anything:

• one mole of sodium atoms is 6.02 × 1023 sodium atoms;
• one mole of chlorine molecules is 6.02 × 1023 chlorine molecules;
• one mole of sodium chloride is 6.02 × 1023 formula units of NaCl;
• one mole of elephants is 6.02 × 1023 elephants.

Although the mole represents an extraordinarily large number, a mole of
atoms, ions, or molecules is an amount that is observable and convenient to
measure and handle. Figure 1 shows a mole of each of three common substances:
an element, an ionic compound, and a molecular compound. In each case, a
mole of entities is a sample size that is convenient for laboratory work.

Molar Mass

Why is this particular number, 6.02 × 1023, so useful for counting atoms, mol-
ecules, and other entities? It is useful because scientists have determined
experimentally that there are 6.02 × 1023 carbon atoms in 12 g of C-12. In
other words, each atom of C-12 has a mass of 12 u, and each mole of C-12
atoms (6.02 × 1023 atoms) has a mass of 12 g. Isn’t that convenient? Notice
how the unit of mass changes from atomic unit (u) to grams (g) as we change
from talking about a single atom to talking about a mole of atoms. The mole
allows us to easily convert atomic mass into mass in grams. Let’s see how this
conversion works.

Consider a single Mg-24 atom. It has a mass of 24 u, twice the mass of a
single C-12 atom. Since a mole of C-12 atoms has a mass of 12 g, it follows that

a mole of Mg-24 atoms must also have twice the mass, 24 g. We can recognize a
relationship between the atomic mass and the mass of a mole of atoms of an ele-
ment. If the atomic mass is 12 u, the mass of a mole of atoms is 12 g. If the atomic
mass is 24 u, the mass of a mole of atoms is 24 g. This relationship applies to all
elements:

• mass of one C-12 atom is 12 u; mass of one mole of C-12 atoms is 12 g;
• mass of one Al-27 atom is 27 u; mass of one mole of Al-27 atoms is 27 g;
• mass of one N-14 atom is 14 u; mass of one mole of N-14 atoms is 14 g;
• mass of one O-16 atom is 16 u; mass of one mole of O-16 atoms is 16 g.

The relationship between the mass of atoms and the mass of moles also
applies to molecules and ions. Take, for example, a molecule of water, H2O. It
consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. The average mass
of a single water molecule is the sum of the average masses of its compo-
nents—2.02 u (2 H) and 16.00 u (O)—totalling 18.02 u. Since the average mol-
ecule of water has a mass of 18.02 u, one mole of water molecules has a mass
of 18.02 g. When we measure 18.02 g of water in a container, using a balance,
we have in effect “counted” 6.02 × 1023 molecules of H2O in the container
(Figure 2).

Since electrons have negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons, ions
have essentially the same mass as their corresponding atoms. Thus a chloride ion
(Cl–) has the same mass as a chlorine atom, 35.49 u. A mole of chloride ions has
the same mass as a mole of chlorine atoms, 35.49 g. When ions combine to form
ionic compounds, the mass of one formula unit is the sum of the masses of the
ions in the unit. Thus, the mass of one formula unit of sodium chloride is the
sum of the mass of one sodium ion and one chloride ion.

The mass in grams of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass (SI
unit, g/mol; SI symbol M). One mole of carbon atoms has a molar mass of
12.01 g/mol. Similarly, one mole of water molecules has a molar mass of
18.02 g/mol.

When we communicate amounts in moles, it is important to specify the
entity being measured. Note the two values for the molar mass of oxygen:

molar mass of oxygen atoms � 16.00 g/mol

molar mass of oxygen molecules � 32.00 g/mol

In the first value of molar mass, oxygen atoms are being counted; in the
second, oxygen molecules are being counted. The molar mass of oxygen atoms
(O) is 16.00 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen molecules (O2) is 32.00 g/mol.
The difference in molar mass reflects the difference between the mass of an
oxygen atom and that of an oxygen molecule. As we normally encounter it,

oxygen is diatomic, composed of two atoms (Figure 3). The usual form of the
element is O2, so a mole of oxygen usually means a mole of oxygen molecules
rather than oxygen atoms. The same interpretation applies to the other elements
that form diatomic molecules: H2, N2, F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2. Unless otherwise
stated, a mole of each of these elements is taken to mean a mole of molecules. To
avoid ambiguity, however, it is always best to specify whether the entity discussed
is an atom or a molecule.

Sample Problem

What is the molar mass of ammonium phosphate, (NH4)3PO4? 

Solution

M(NH4)3PO4
� 3(N + 4H) + P + 4O

4.4 Calculations Involving the Mole 
Concept

In this section, we will apply the mole concept in a number of situations that we
encounter frequently in the study of chemical reactions. Chemical formulas and
equations are expressed using amount in moles. In a laboratory, we measure mass.
So we constantly need to convert amount in moles into mass and vice versa.

Think about the term molar mass. It contains the concepts of both moles and
mass. We always use molar mass in connecting the two measurements of amount
in moles and mass.

Converting Mass to Amount in Moles

To calculate an amount in moles, we take the given mass in grams and divide by
the molar mass. Let’s take an example. Each mole of carbon atoms has a mass of
12 g. If we have 24 g of carbon atoms, what is the amount in moles? Since 24 g is
twice 12 g, we have 2.0 moles of carbon atoms.

Mathematically, when we divide the mass we are given, 24 g, by the molar
mass, 12 g/mol, we get 2.0 mol.

Converting Amount in Moles to Mass

If we know the amount in moles of a reactant or a product, we can calculate the mass
by using the molar mass. Consider the amount of 2.0 mol of sodium hydroxide,
NaOH(s). The molar mass of NaOH(s) is (22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01) g/mol, or 40.00
g/mol. The mass of 2.0 mol of NaOH(s) would be exactly double the mass of 1.0 mol
of NaOH(s). Therefore, the mass of 2.0 mol of NaOH(s) is double 40 g, which is 80 g.

Mathematically, in order to calculate the mass of a substance, we multiply
the amount in moles by its molar mass.

Calculations Involving Number of Entities

We often need to know the number of entities in a sample of a substance. When
dealing with gases, for example, the number of atoms or molecules in a container
is related to other factors, such as the temperature and the pressure of the gas.

We will first look at how we can convert an amount in moles into the
number of entities. We know there are always 6.02 × 1023 entities in a mole of
substance. If we have 2.0 mol of copper, then there will be 2.0 × 6.02 × 1023
copper atoms. The number of entities, N, in an amount in moles is calculated by
multiplying the amount in moles by 6.02 × 1023, Avogadro’s constant:

N � nNA.

Now let’s look at calculating the number of entities in a given mass. How
many copper atoms do you think there are in a penny? (We’ll assume our pen-
nies are dated before 1997, since after this time they were no longer made of
copper, but copper-plated zinc.) The calculations are similar to the preceding
example; however, since we are not told the amount in moles, we need to first
convert the mass into amount in moles.

Our strategy is first to measure the mass of the penny (Figure 2). Then we
convert the mass into amount in moles. Finally, we can convert the amount in
moles to number of atoms. Mass and number of entities are both easily con-
verted to amount in moles, so the middle step in these conversions is always to
determine the amount in moles.

Suppose we measured the mass of a penny and found it to be 2.63 g. We will
convert this mass to amount in moles of copper atoms.

Using molar mass values  from a periodic table, we can calculate the mass of reac-
tants and products in chemical reactions—if we already know the chemical for-
mulas. However, when a new substance is produced, we first need to determine its
chemical formula. To do this, we need to determine the chemical composition of the
compound, that is, what elements it is made of and the quantities of each element.

In this section, we will experimentally determine the composition by mass of
a substance and then convert the mass amounts to percentages, to give us the
percentage composition. We can then use atomic mass and molar mass to deter-
mine the correct chemical formula.

Before we begin, we will practise the mathematical steps in the calculation of
percentage composition from mass measurements of reactants and products.
Let’s consider 20 g of red jelly beans mixed with 30 g of green jelly beans. What
is the percentage composition of the mixture, by mass? The percentage of red
jelly beans by mass would be 20 g of the total 50 g, which is 20 g/50 g × 100%, or
40%. Similarly, the percentage of green jelly beans would be 30 g of the total 50 g,
which is 60%.

Now let’s look at the percentage composition of water. Water is formed when
hydrogen is allowed to react with oxygen, a reaction that gives off large amounts
of energy (Figure 1). The results of an experiment revealed that 2.5 g of
hydrogen, when completely reacted, produced 22.5 g of water. What is the per-
centage composition of water by mass?

Since 2.5 g of hydrogen combined with an amount of oxygen to produce
22.5 g of water, we can calculate the mass of oxygen by subtraction:

Using molar mass values  from a periodic table, we can calculate the mass of reac-
tants and products in chemical reactions—if we already know the chemical for-
mulas. However, when a new substance is produced, we first need to determine its
chemical formula. To do this, we need to determine the chemical composition of the
compound, that is, what elements it is made of and the quantities of each element.

In this investigation, you will test the law of definite proportions. To do this, you
will determine the composition by mass of magnesium oxide, calculate the per-
centage composition, and compare your results and those of other students to
the predicted values.

Magnesium is a silvery metal that burns with such a bright flame that it was
once used in flashbulbs for photography. Magnesium oxide, a white powder, is
produced as a result of the synthesis reaction of combusting magnesium. Here,
you will conduct a slow combustion of magnesium and then complete the
Evidence, Analysis, and Evaluation sections of a lab report.

Questions

What is the percentage composition by mass of magnesium oxide?
Is this percentage constant?

Prediction

(a) Make a prediction based on the law of definite proportions. What should
the percentage composition by mass of magnesium oxide be?

Experimental Design

A known mass of magnesium metal is heated in a crucible over a laboratory
burner. The mass of the magnesium oxide formed is used to determine the mass
of the oxygen that reacted and the percentage composition by mass of the two
components. Some of the magnesium also reacts with nitrogen in air to form a
nitride. This compound is converted to magnesium oxide by adding water and
reheating the solid.

used in devices such as flares, incendiary
bombs, and fireworks. Magnesium dust is a
common component of fireworks, including
sparklers, a nonexplosive type of fireworks
constructed by coating a slurry of chemicals

taining magnesium powder, an oxidizer, iron
or steel powder, and a binder, all of which
are proportioned to burn slowly, giving off a

2. Polish the magnesium ribbon with the steel wool and fold the ribbon to fit
into the bottom of the crucible.

3. Determine the mass of the crucible, lid, and magnesium ribbon.

4. Place the crucible securely on the clay triangle. Set the lid slightly off-centre
on the crucible to allow air to enter but to prevent the magnesium oxide
from escaping.

5. Place the laboratory burner under the crucible, light it, and begin heating
with a gentle flame.

6. Gradually increase the flame intensity until all the magnesium turns into a
white powder.

7. Cut the flow of gas to the burner and allow the crucible, lid, and contents
to cool.

8. Using the stirring rod, crush the contents of the crucible into a fine
powder. Carefully add about 10 mL of distilled water to the powder. Use
some of the water to rinse any powder on the stirring rod into the crucible.

9. Heat the crucible and contents, with the lid slightly ajar, gently for 3 min
and strongly for another 7 min.

10. Allow the crucible and contents to cool.

Percentage Composition Calculations from a Formula

We have seen how to determine the percentage composition of a compound
through experimentation. Empirical information is often used to determine the
formula of a compound.

Sometimes we also need to calculate the percentage composition of a com-
pound whose formula we already know. For example, we may wish to verify the
purity of a compound by comparing its percentage composition obtained exper-
imentally to the theoretical value, calculated from the compound’s formula.
Percentage composition also has commercial uses, for example, in fertilizers. The
chemical formula can be used to determine the percentage by mass that is con-
tributed by each element in the compounds that make up the fertilizer. Nitrogen
is one of the key elements delivered to plants by fertilizers; it is important to cal-
culate the percentage of nitrogen in fertilizer compounds to determine the cor-
rect quantities of fertilizer to apply.

If we know the chemical formula of the compound, calculating percentage
composition is straightforward. Essentially, we want to calculate the “contribu-
tion” of each element to the total mass of the compound. Thus, we first calcu-
late the mass of all the atoms of each element. Then, we calculate the total mass
of all the elements in the compound. To obtain the percentage contribution of
each element, we divide the mass of each element by the total mass.

4.6 Empirical and Molecular
Formulas

If we are given an unknown substance and we want to find its chemical formula,
how do we begin? We need to identify the elements that are in the compound as
well as the number of atoms of each element. To begin with, we can determine
its percentage composition by mass. Then, we simply convert the mass values
into amounts in moles, which gives us the subscripts in the chemical formula of
the substance.

A formula derived in this way is called an empirical formula, which means
that it is derived from observations in an experiment rather than from theory. An
empirical formula tells us the simplest ratio of the combining elements.

Currently, many new substances that are synthesized are organic com-
pounds, that is, contain mainly carbon and hydrogen atoms. One of the tech-
nologies available to measure the percentage composition of these compounds
uses combustion analyzers (Figure 1). In this process, several milligrams of a
compound are burned inside a combustion chamber. When the compound is
burned, oxygen combines with the carbon atoms to form carbon dioxide and
with the hydrogen atoms to form water vapour. Any other elements present are
similarly converted to their oxides. The quantities of these combustion products
are precisely measured, and computer analysis discloses the percentage by mass
of each element detected in the compound. This percentage composition is then
used to calculate the empirical formula of the compound.

An empirical formula does not necessarily provide the correct information
about the number of atoms in a molecule. That is, an empirical formula may not

be the correct formula. Different molecules may have the same percentage com-
position but contain different numbers of atoms in a molecule. For example,
ethyne (also known as acetylene), used in welders’ torches, and benzene, used as
a solvent, both have the same percentage composition by mass, so they also have
the same empirical formula, CH. A molecular formula is needed to tell us the
actual number and kind of atoms in a molecule of the substance. The molecular
formula for ethyne is C2H2, and the molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
Table 1 compares the properties of ethyne and benzene.

To further illustrate the difference between empirical and molecular for-
mulas, let’s revisit the compound hydrogen peroxide. Observations from decom-
position or synthesis experiments reveal that hydrogen peroxide contains
hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms in a combining ratio of 1:1. The empirical
formula for hydrogen peroxide is, therefore, HO. When other information such
as the mass of a molecule is taken into account, we find that each molecule of
hydrogen peroxide contains two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms
(Figure 2). Thus, the molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2.

As you can see, H2O2 is a multiple of the empirical formula HO. The empir-
ical formula HO gives the combining ratio in its simplest form, and the molec-
ular formula H2O2 gives the same ratio in the actual number of combining
atoms. In this case, the subscripts in the molecular formula H2O2 are double the
subscripts in the empirical formula HO. In other cases, the empirical and molec-
ular formulas may be the same. Water is an example in which the empirical for-
mula, H2O, is the same as the molecular formula, H2O.

4.7 Calculating Chemical Formulas
In section 4.5, you synthesized magnesium oxide by heating magnesium ribbon
in a crucible in the presence of oxygen. By analyzing the masses of each element
reacted and the mass of the compound formed, you calculated the percentage
composition. We will now use that information to illustrate how an empirical
formula can be determined from percentage composition.

Calculating an Empirical Formula

Suppose that the results of Investigation 4.5.1 gave us the following percentage
composition of magnesium oxide: 60% magnesium and 40% oxygen. This
means, in effect, that in 100.00 g of the compound, there are 60.00 g of magne-
sium atoms and 40.00 g of oxygen atoms. Now we can determine how many
atoms there are in 60.00 g of magnesium and how many atoms there are in
40.00 g of oxygen. We will then know the ratio of the number of magnesium
atoms to oxygen atoms.

First we convert 60.00 g of magnesium to an amount in moles:

MMg � 24.31 g/mol

4.7 Calculating Chemical Formulas
In section 4.5, you synthesized magnesium oxide by heating magnesium ribbon
in a crucible in the presence of oxygen. By analyzing the masses of each element
reacted and the mass of the compound formed, you calculated the percentage
composition. We will now use that information to illustrate how an empirical
formula can be determined from percentage composition.

Calculating an Empirical Formula

Suppose that the results of Investigation 4.5.1 gave us the following percentage
composition of magnesium oxide: 60% magnesium and 40% oxygen. This
means, in effect, that in 100.00 g of the compound, there are 60.00 g of magne-
sium atoms and 40.00 g of oxygen atoms. Now we can determine how many
atoms there are in 60.00 g of magnesium and how many atoms there are in
40.00 g of oxygen. We will then know the ratio of the number of magnesium
atoms to oxygen atoms.

First we convert 60.00 g of magnesium to an amount in moles:

MMg � 24.31 g/mol

nMg � 60.00 g� × �2

Since the mole ratio of the two elements is 1:1, the empirical formula of
magnesium oxide is MgO. Since magnesium oxide is an ionic compound, the
empirical formula indicates that the ratio of magnesium ions to oxide ions is 1:1.

From the percentage composition, we can merely tell the ratio of atoms, or
ions, not the actual number. Based only on the empirical evidence from the inves-
tigation, the formula for this compound could be MgO, Mg2O2, Mg3O3, or any
other multiple. We would need to know the molar mass of the compound to be
able to determine the molecular formula.

Sample Problem 1

What is the empirical formula for a compound whose percentage composition is
21.6% sodium, 33.3% chlorine, and 45.1% oxygen?

Solution

mNa � 21.6% × 100.0 g Na � 21.6 g MNa � 22.99 g/mol

mCl � 33.3% × 100.0 g Cl � 33.3 g MCl � 35.45 g/mol

The mole ratio (Na:Cl:O) is 0.940:0.939:2.82. Dividing by 0.939 to obtain the
lowest ratio, we get the mole ratio of Na:Cl:O � 1:1:3.

The empirical formula of the compound is NaClO3.

7. An oxide of copper reacts with carbon to produce carbon dioxide and
copper metal. High temperatures are required for the reaction to
occur, and sufficient carbon must be supplied to allow all the oxide of
copper to react. One of the products formed in this reaction is a gas,
so only the masses of the starting oxide of copper and the product,
copper metal, can be easily determined.
(a) Design an experiment to determine the empirical formula of the

copper oxide. Complete a report outlining your experimental
design and the procedure you would follow, create a blank table
in which you could record the evidence you would need to
obtain, and describe how you would analyze the evidence.

(b) Predict the evidence you would obtain if the molecular formula of
the compound is Cu2O.

Calculating a Molecular Formula

The empirical formula tells us the ratio of atoms in a molecule, but does not tell us
the number of atoms in a molecule of the compound. The molar mass takes into
account all of the atoms in a molecule. Therefore, if we know the molar mass of a
compound and its empirical formula, we can determine its molecular formula.

Let’s return to our example of water and hydrogen peroxide. The percentage
composition of water, determined by experiment, is 11.1% hydrogen and 88.9%
oxygen. This gives us a mole ratio of H:O of 2:1 and an empirical formula of
H2O. If this were the correct formula for water, the molar mass of water would
be 18.02 g/mol. We find that when the molar mass is determined, it is indeed
18.02 g/mol, which suggests that the empirical formula we obtained is also the
molecular formula.

In the case of hydrogen peroxide, the percentage composition is 5.9%
hydrogen and 94.1% oxygen, giving us a mole ratio of H:O of 1:1 and an empirical
formula of HO. If HO were the molecular formula, the molar mass would be 
17.01 g/mol. The molar mass, determined by measurement, is actually 34.02 g/mol,
double the empirical molar mass. Therefore, the molecular formula must be H2O2.

Determine its molecular formula.

Solution

MCH3
� 15.04 g/mol

The actual molar mass is twice the molar mass predicted by the empirical for-
mula. Therefore, the molecular formula is C2H6.

Determining Molar Mass of New Compounds

For new substances the molecular formula is unknown, so we cannot calculate
molar masses from the atomic masses in the periodic table. The molar mass of a
new substance has to be determined experimentally. Of the number of labora-
tory methods available to determine molar mass, chemists most often rely on a
mass spectrometer.

In a mass spectrometer, a small gaseous sample is bombarded by a beam 
of electrons, which causes the molecules to break up into charged fragments.
For example, the two main fragments for a particular compound are shown in
Figure 1. The fragments are accelerated by an electric field and then deflected by
a magnetic field. The amount of deflection depends on the mass and the charge
of the fragment. From the amount of deflection, the molar mass of the original
sample can be determined. The mass spectrum (the evidence from a mass spec-
trometer test) of the compound shown in Figure 2 shows several fragments.

Let’s consider an empirical analysis of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), designed to
determine its molecular formula. Experiment reveals that it is a compound of C,
H, and O. A combustion analyzer reveals that the combustion of 1.000 g of
ascorbic acid produces 1.500 g of CO2 and 0.405 g of H2O.

First, we will find the mass of the C atoms (12.01 g/mol) in 1.500 g of the
carbon oxide that was formed, CO2 (44.01 g/mol):

Some of the oxygen in the products came from ascorbic acid, and some came
from the oxygen present in the combustion chamber. However, there is an easy
way to find the mass of oxygen in the ascorbic acid. We simply subtract the cal-
culated masses of carbon and hydrogen from the original mass of ascorbic acid,
and what remains must be the mass of the oxygen:

mO � 1.00 g – (0.409 g + 0.045 g)

The ratio of C:H:O is thus 0.034:0.045:0.034. Dividing by the common
value, we obtain 1:1.32:1. To convert the ratio to whole numbers, we multiply by
3 (chosen because it’s the lowest multiplier that brings the 1.32 close to a whole
number) to obtain 3:3.96:3, or 3:4:3, and an empirical formula of C3H4O3.

If this were the molecular formula, the molar mass of ascorbic acid would be
88.07 g/mol. However, with the use of a mass spectrometer, the molar mass of
ascorbic acid is determined to be 176.14 g/mol, which is twice the molar mass
predicted by the empirical formula. Based on the empirical evidence, the molec-
ular formula for ascorbic acid is C6H8O6.

Natural Vitamins

Earlier we analyzed ascorbic acid (vitamin C) empirically, using evidence from a
combustion analyzer and a mass spectrometer. The percentage composition and
molecular mass confirmed the molecular formula C6H8O6. Does ascorbic acid
from natural sources, such as from rosehips (Figure 3) and some fruits, have the
same molecular formula and percentage composition as chemically synthesized
ascorbic acid, that is, from a laboratory where atoms and molecules have been
poured and mixed? The law of definite proportions tells us that a compound
always has the same composition, no matter how it is made.

Store shelves are full of vitamin and mineral supplements; usually both nat-
ural and chemically synthesized products are available. But the cost of supple-
ments from natural sources is generally several times more than the synthetic
substitutes. Judging by the abundance of brands and stores specializing in nat-
ural health products, people are happy to pay the extra cost for the natural
product. Are natural vitamins worth the money?

Depending on who is asked, the answer to that question varies. The manu-
facturer of the natural products might tell you that its products are indeed worth
more because they cost more to make (natural materials must be harvested and
processed, instead of being synthesized by mass production). They also offer
greater health benefits. Natural products contain more than just the vitamin, for
example, that a pharmaceutical company sells. It is claimed that these ingredients
work together naturally to enhance the positive effects of the product, including
by speeding or increasing absorption and by providing therapeutic effects not
offered by the pure chemical. Another benefit claimed for natural products is
that many of them have been used for centuries in traditional medicine (ginseng,
echinacea, and St. Johns wort are all examples), and that over that time they have
proved their worth.

A manufacturer of chemical compounds would offer a different answer:
vitamin C is vitamin C, C6H8O6, whether it is made by a rose or by a factory. It
might claim that the extra ingredients in the natural products are a cause of con-
cern, in that their effects are sometimes not well known and could be harmful.
For example, many plants produce toxins to discourage animals from eating their
seeds and leaves. These toxins could find their way into a natural product based
on plant material. Another criticism of the natural products is that, unlike the
pharmaceutical product in which each pill is identical, natural products some-
times vary in their composition, so the dosage is less well known.

When crystals form from the evaporation of an aqueous solution of a salt, water
molecules often become incorporated into the crystal structure. When these
crystals are heated, these loosely held water molecules are lost. This type of
crystal is called a hydrate, and the water is called water of hydration.

Gypsum (Figure 4), the common name for the chemical used in plaster casts
and sculptures, is a hydrate of calcium sulfate. Its formula is CaSO4•2H2O, a
dihydrate (or 2-water), which means that it has two molecules of water for each
CaSO4 formula unit. When the dihydrate is heated, it loses some of its water of
hydration and forms crystals of (CaSO4)2•H2O. When these crystals are ground
and moistened, they absorb water and are converted back to the dihydrate, solid-
ifying within minutes.

In this investigation, you will determine the formula of an unknown hydrate
by determining the amount in moles of water of hydration that is lost from a

One of the most useful applications of chemistry is the synthesis of new substances
that benefit society. New medicines are developed every year, and new materials for
clothing, sports equipment, and cleaning products are advertised daily.

That is why the discovery of new and better ways of synthesizing existing chem-
icals is so exciting. New procedures often follow the development of new technolo-
gies and always require an understanding of both qualitative and quantitative
aspects of chemical reactions. Industries are particularly interested in the costs of
their chemical processes, and quantitative analysis is key to a company’s profitability.

Let’s take the example of the production of soda ash (sodium carbonate,
Na2CO3(s)). You may have used sodium carbonate as a cleaner, commonly called
washing soda. It was first extracted from plant ashes and used to make soap. In
1775, as the demand for soap exceeded the supply of sodium carbonate, the
French Academy of Science offered a prize for the development of an industrial
method of making sodium carbonate from common substances. As a result of
this offer, the LeBlanc process was developed. To make sodium carbonate using
the LeBlanc process, sodium chloride and sulfuric acid are heated; then lime-
stone and coal are added and heated again, to a high temperature. Quantitatively,
the LeBlanc process was inefficient. It required burning a lot of coal, which was
expensive and generated hydrogen chloride, a severe air pollutant. One of the
byproducts was an insoluble residue that had no commercial value. In other
words, a great deal of resources and energy was put into the reaction, and only a
small proportion of the materials was recovered as a useful product.

It was not until 1867—after approximately a hundred years of using the
LeBlanc process—that a new process was developed for the production of
sodium carbonate. You will learn more about this Solvay process later in the
chapter (Figure 1); you will also learn how to calculate amounts of substances
taking part in chemical reactions and how science and technology are linked in
the search for better products and processes.

Soap making was a yearly event undertaken
by early Canadian settlers. Waste cooking
grease and wood ashes were collected year-

results. Advances in the industrial production
of soaps led to great improvements in 
personal hygiene and public health.

When sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO3(s), commonly called baking
soda, reacts with an acid such as acetic acid (in vinegar), carbon dioxide
is produced. In this activity, you will compare the amounts of gas pro-
duced when a fixed amount of sodium hydrogen carbonate is mixed
with increasing amounts of acetic acid.

Materials: eye protection, sodium hydrogen carbonate (100 mL, approxi-
mately 5 tbsp.), 300 mL vinegar (5% acetic acid), 3 small, sealable plastic
bags, graduated cylinder, measuring spoon

Acetic acid in vinegar may irritate the eyes. If acetic acid
comes in contact with the eye, immediately wash the eye
under cold running water.

• Using the measuring spoon, carefully place 15 mL (approximately
3 tsp.) of sodium hydrogen carbonate into a bottom corner of one
bag. Fold the corner upward and tape it in place so that the solid is
kept out of contact with other ingredients to be added to the bag.

• Carefully pour 30 mL of vinegar into the other bottom corner of the
bag, keeping it out of contact with the solid.

• Flatten and press the bag gently to remove as much air as possible,
and seal the bag.

• Remove the tape and shake the bag to allow the sodium hydrogen
carbonate to mix well with the vinegar.

• Allow the reaction to continue until no more bubbles are produced.
Keep the bag sealed for later observations.

• Repeat the procedure with another bag, using the same amount of
sodium hydrogen carbonate and increasing the amount of vinegar
to 60 mL.

• Repeat, increasing the amount of vinegar to 120 mL.

(a) Record the relative volumes of gas in the three sealed bags. Is
there evidence that the amount of product formed is related to
the amount of reactants used?

(b) Is there evidence that some of the sodium hydrogen carbonate
had not completely reacted in one or more of the bags? 

• Open each bag and add 15 mL of vinegar to each.

(c) Is there evidence that a shortage of vinegar was limiting the
production of carbon dioxide gas in some bags?

• Add 15 mL of sodium hydrogen carbonate to each bag.

(d) Is there evidence that a lack of sodium hydrogen carbonate was
limiting the production of carbon dioxide gas in some bags?

(e) When sodium hydrogen carbonate, a bitter-tasting base, is used
to make lemon cake, it reacts with the citric acid in the lemon
juice to produce bubbles of carbon dioxide. Should the amount
of sodium hydrogen carbonate be chosen to limit the produc-
tion of bubbles, or should it be used in excess amounts?
Explain your answer.

(f) Some recipes give measurements in capacity units (e.g., 
millilitres or teaspoons of baking soda) while others use mass
units (e.g., grams of flour). Explain which of these measure-
ments you think is more accurate.

5.1 Quantitative Analysis
When a driver is asked to breathe into a breathalyzer, the instrument analyzes the
breath sample and measures the quantity of alcohol in the exhaled air (Figure 1).
At a swimming pool, a lifeguard may take a sample of water to analyze the quan-
tity of acid or amount of chemicals needed to disinfect the water. Soil and well
water samples may be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed for the quantity of toxic
ions or bacterial content. In all of these cases, the quantity of a substance in a
sample is measured. This type of analysis is called quantitative analysis; it
requires a combination of scientific concepts, precision equipment, and technical
expertise (Figure 2).

Many different strategies are used in quantitative analysis. For instance, if the
substance we wish to analyze is in solution, we can allow the substance to com-
pletely react to form a precipitate. We can then collect and measure the quantity
of the precipitate and use our knowledge of the chemical reaction to calculate the
quantity of the substance that was in the original solution.

In this strategy, we need to ensure that the substance we wish to quantify is
completely reacted and that none of it remains in solution, unaccounted for. In
order to do this, we need to supply enough of any other reactant that is taking
part in the reaction. In fact, we usually supply more than enough, or an excess,
of the other reactants. In this way, the reaction will continue until all of the sub-
stance we wish to quantify has been used up. The quantity of this substance is the
limiting factor in the reaction, and this substance is called the limiting reagent.
The other reactants that are supplied in excess are called excess reagents.

Recall the activity at the beginning of this chapter, reacting sodium hydrogen
carbonate with different amounts of acetic acid, producing carbon dioxide gas.
After the reaction stopped in the first bag, we could still see solid sodium
hydrogen carbonate remaining in the bag, unreacted. The reaction must have
stopped because it ran out of the other reactant, the acetic acid. When more
acetic acid was added to the bag, the bubbling began again as carbon dioxide was
again produced. This shows that acetic acid had indeed been completely used up
and was the limiting reagent in this case.

In the third bag, when the reaction stopped, all of the sodium hydrogen car-
bonate had disappeared. When more sodium hydrogen carbonate was added to
the bag, the reaction resumed. This confirmed that, in this bag, the absent reac-
tant causing the reaction to stop was sodium hydrogen carbonate, which was thus
the limiting reagent. Acetic acid had been present in excess, as evidenced by the
resumption of the reaction without any more acetic acid being added to the bag.

We often use household substances in excess or as limiting reagents, as
needed. When we wash greasy dishes, for example, we usually add an excess of
detergent to the dishwater to react with and remove the grease. If droplets of
grease remain visible on the dishes, the detergent has become the limiting
reagent and it is time to add more detergent if we wish to remove all the grease.
In another example, calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water react
with soap molecules to form an insoluble scum. To soften the water for laundry,
the calcium and magnesium ions can be precipitated out by adding sodium car-
bonate (washing soda). The sodium carbonate is used in excess to ensure that all
of the ions causing hard water are removed from the solution before soap is
added.

We sometimes select the limiting reagent in a reaction in order to control the
amount of a product formed. In winemaking, for example, the alcohol content
of a wine can be controlled by making the sugar the limiting reagent. The sugar

is a reactant in the fermentation process, and when the sugar is used up, the reac-
tion stops. In baking, the amount of baking soda used is often the limiting
reagent in the production of carbon dioxide bubbles, thus controlling the texture
of a chewy cookie or a spongy cake. Quantities of limiting reagents must be care-
fully calculated and measured because they determine the quantity of all the
products formed.

Practice

Understanding Concepts

1. If there are only two reactants in a quantitative chemical reaction, is
there always a limiting reagent?

2. If you are trying to determine the amount of substance A by reacting
it with a solution of substance B, which substance must be the lim-
iting reagent and which must be in excess? Explain your reasoning.

Excess Reagents in Quantitative Analysis

We can usually decide on the amount of limiting reagent to use in a chemical
analysis, but how do we predict the quantity of excess reagent to use with it? A
procedure involving trial and error may be required. For a precipitation reaction,
increasing amounts of the excess reagent may be added to a known trial quantity
of the limiting reagent, until no more precipitate forms. The quantity of excess
reagent added gives an estimate of the quantity required for the experiment. This
procedure is detailed below.

1. Precisely measure a convenient volume (e.g., 80 mL) of the limiting reagent
solution.

2. Slowly add a small volume (e.g., 20 mL) of the excess reagent solution.

3. Allow the precipitate to settle enough so that you can see a clear solution at
the top of the mixture.

4. Add a few more drops of the excess reagent (Figure 3).

5. If more cloudiness appears, which indicates that the reaction has not yet
been completed, add another small volume (e.g., 20 mL) and repeat steps 3
and 4.

6. Continue until no more cloudiness appears on adding a few drops of the
excess reagent. Record the volumes of both reactants and use this informa-
tion to calculate the volumes needed in the experiment.

Alternatively, the mixture may be filtered and a diagnostic test performed on
the filtrate to determine if any unreacted chemical remains. For example, a flame
test might be used to test for any unreacted limiting reagent that remains.

Another strategy used in quantitative analysis is to compare, using graphs,
empirical observations against known values. For example, in a medical labora-
tory, laboratory technologists routinely analyze blood and urine samples for spe-
cific chemicals, such as cholesterol and sugar. To help with their interpretation,
they compare their results against graphs that have been prepared using known
values. This type of graph is called a standard curve; it lets us match values from
unknown samples to values from known samples previously determined under
the same conditions.

Figure 3

(a) Once the precipitate settles and the top
layer appears clear, you can test for the
completeness of the reaction. 

(b) Carefully run a drop or two of the excess
reagent down the side of the beaker and
watch for additional precipitation, indi-
cating that some of the limiting reagent
remains in the solution.When adding sev-
eral drops of the excess reagent solution
no longer creates cloudiness, the reagent
is indeed in excess.

206 Chapter 5

To illustrate the use of a standard curve, Table 1 shows reference data obtained
in the double displacement reaction of aqueous lead(II) nitrate and potassium
iodide. The relationship between the mass of the reactant, Pb(NO3)2(aq), and the
mass of the product, PbI2(s), is graphed as a standard curve (Figure 4). An
unknown solution of Pb(NO3)2(aq) can then be analyzed by using the graph to
match the mass of PbI2(s) that is precipitated under the same conditions.

In this investigation, the skills used by chemical technicians in the quantitative
analysis of a substance by precipitation are practised.

You will determine the mass of sodium carbonate in a solution by using
experimental data and a standard curve, the data for which are supplied. Conduct
the investigation, Analyze the evidence, and Evaluate the experimental design.

Question

What is the mass of sodium carbonate present in a 50.0-mL sample of a solution?

Experimental Design

The mass of sodium carbonate present in the sample solution is determined by
having it react with an excess quantity of calcium chloride in solution. A double
displacement reaction takes place; one of the products formed, calcium car-
bonate, is insoluble in water. The only other product formed is sodium chloride,
which is soluble in water. The mass of calcium carbonate precipitate produced is
used to determine the mass of sodium carbonate that reacted. The value is read
from a standard curve plotted using reference data in Table 2.

There are many interesting and rewarding careers that combine
analysis of unknown substances with other areas of study. Find out
more about one of the examples outlined on this page or another
career in quantitative analysis that matches your interests.

Quantitative Careers

Chemical Laboratory Technician

Laboratory technicians are an important part of any analytical team,
whether it is in medical diagnosis or industrial research. In a medical
laboratory, technicians run analytical procedures on blood, urine, or
tissue samples. In pharmaceutical companies, they analyze product
samples to ensure that the quantities of active ingredients are exact.
In industry, technicians maintain or improve product quality, using var-
ious separation and purification techniques. In addition to good tech-
nical skills and precision instrumentation, technicians need excellent
communication skills to prepare reports on the results of the analyses.

Art Conservationist

An art conservationist combines the technology of chemical analysis with a knowledge
of art history to determine the extent of damage to artwork and methods of restoration.
For example, one technique may involve the application of minimal amounts of solvent
to a historical painting, followed by quantitative analysis of the swab by infrared spec-
troscopy. Other procedures may include the use of microscopes and X-ray machines to
identify the chemical composition of materials used in the painting. Working closely
with art historians, an art conservationist may use this information to assess the
authenticity of a piece of artwork.

Forensic Chemist

Forensic chemists work with police forces, customs officers, and fire
department investigators to analyze materials that are related to a
criminal offence. They prepare reports that may become part of a trial
and often appear in court as expert witnesses, answering questions
about the analysis of the materials on exhibit. To identify materials,
forensic chemists rely on a variety of technologies, including
microscopy, gas chromatography, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray dif-
fraction. An understanding of statistics is also important in deter-

5.2 Balancing Chemical Equations
Before we can analyze a chemical reaction quantitatively, we have to know the
quantitative relationship between reactants and products. Is there a simple
“recipe” for a chemical reaction that tells us how much material we need to start
with and how much product we will end up with? Yes, indeed there is. All the
information we need is incorporated in a balanced chemical equation. Writing a
balanced equation is almost always the first step in a quantitative analysis, and we
will briefly review the skills you learned and practised earlier. Let’s use the
method of balancing equations “by inspection,” which means that we will simply
count the number of atoms of each element before and after the reaction and
adjust coefficients to make sure the numbers are the same for each element.

Let’s examine an equation for the reaction between copper metal and silver
nitrate solution. First, we observe metallic copper wire, Cu(s), being immersed in
a colourless solution of silver nitrate, AgNO3(aq),. The solution gradually changes
colour to blue, and sparkling crystals form on the copper wire. Diagnostic tests
confirm that the blue solution is due to formation of copper(II) nitrate,
Cu(NO3)2(aq), which goes into solution, and the crystals are metallic silver, Ag(s).
This reaction is used industrially to recover and recycle silver by trickling waste
solutions containing silver ions over scrap copper.

Write a reaction equation, including states of matter:

? Cu(s) + ? AgNO3(aq) → ? Ag(s) + ? Cu(NO3)2(aq)

First, balance atoms that are not in polyatomic ions, and are not O or H.
(Oxygen and hydrogen atoms may be constituents of many compounds in a
reaction. Balancing O and H early could be counterproductive, as they might
need to be rebalanced again at a later stage.) In this case, we can start with Cu
and Ag, but as stated they are already balanced (one atom of each on each side of
the equation). Our equation remains unchanged.

? Cu(s) + ? AgNO3(aq) → ? Ag(s) + ? Cu(NO3)2(aq)

Next, balance any polyatomic ions. In this case, there are two (NO3)
– ions in

the product, but only one in the reactant, so the quantity of the reactant com-
pound needs to be doubled:

? Cu(s)+ 2 AgNO3(aq) → ? Ag(s) + ? Cu(NO3)2(aq)

Doubling AgNO3 requires doubling of the Ag after reaction:

? Cu(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + ? Cu(NO3)2(aq)

Next, balance O atoms and H atoms. We have none in this case.
Balance any remaining elements, such as H2 or O2. Again, we have none, so

we can state our final equation:

Cu(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + Cu(NO3)2(aq)

Final check:
Before reaction: 1 Cu, 2 Ag, 2 (NO3)
After reaction: 1 Cu, 2 Ag, 2 (NO3)
The equation is balanced as stated.

5.2

This systematic approach generally reduces the time spent in a random trial-
and-error method. For reactions that involve many reactants and products, a
more detailed system of accounting for atoms may be used. You will learn that
method in later courses.

There is one more tip on balancing some reaction equations that appear to
require fractional coefficients. For example, the following balanced equation
requires 7 atoms of oxygen contained in �

7
2

� molecules of O2.

2 NH3(g) + �
7
2

� O2(g) → 3 H2O + 2 NO2(g)

To avoid fractional coefficients, we double all coefficients, thereby obtaining a
balanced equation of whole number coefficients while retaining the same mole
ratio for the reaction.

4 NH3(g) + 7 O2(g) → 6 H2O + 4 NO2(g)

Sample Problem 1

Write a balanced equation for the reaction of aqueous sodium phosphate and
aqueous calcium chloride to produce sodium chloride in solution and a precip-
itate of calcium phosphate.

Solution

Na3PO4(aq) +  CaCl2(aq) → Ca3(PO4)2(s) +   NaCl(aq)

2 Na3PO4(aq) + 3 CaCl2(aq) → Ca3(PO4)2(s) + 6 NaCl(aq)

Balancing Chemical Equations by
Inspection

1. Write the chemical formula for each reactant and product, including the
state of matter for each one.

2. Try balancing any atom that is not in a polyatomic ion and is not oxygen
or hydrogen.

3. If possible, balance polyatomic ions as a group.

4. Balance the remaining atoms and molecules, taking into account the
oxygen and hydrogen atoms and water; leave until last any elements such
as H2 or O2.

5. Check the final reaction equation to ensure that there is the same number
of each type of atom before and after the reaction.

Mole Ratios in Balanced Chemical Equations

A balanced equation tells us the ratio of the amounts of reactants and products
taking part in a chemical reaction. This ratio applies to the number of entities or,
more usefully, to the amount in moles.

Let’s consider a simple reaction to produce ammonia, NH3(g). You may rec-
ognize the characteristic pungent smell of ammonia since it is used in some
household cleansing agents, such as window cleaner. It is also used as fertilizer,
commonly applied directly to the soil from tanks containing the liquefied gas. As
you can see from its formula, ammonia consists of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms;
in fact, it can be synthesized directly from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. The
balanced equation is given below, together with various interpretations of the
coefficients for each reactant and product:

N2(g) + 3 H2(g) → 2 NH3(g)
1 molecule 3 molecules 2 molecules
1 dozen molecules 3 dozen molecules 2 dozen molecules
1 mol nitrogen 3 mol hydrogen 2 mol ammonia
1 (6.02 × 1023) molecules 3(6.02 × 1023) molecules 2(6.02 × 1023) molecules
6.02 × 1023 molecules 1.81 × 1024 molecules 1.20 × 1024 molecules

Note that the numbers in each row are in the same ratio (1:3:2) whether indi-
vidual molecules, moles, or large numbers of molecules are considered. When
moles are used to express the coefficients in the balanced equation, the ratio of
reacting amounts is called the mole ratio.

The process to produce ammonia described by the equation above is called
the Haber process, invented by the German chemist Fritz Haber in 1913. Later,
during World War I, the Germans used this process to create explosives. Before
this process was developed, the source of the nitrates needed to make explosives
(and fertilizers) was a huge deposit of guano (sea bird droppings) along the coast
of Chile. But the Germans anticipated a British blockade that would cut off this
supply, hence the Haber process. The existence of the Haber process in effect pro-
longed the war for several years, indirectly causing the loss of many more lives.
However, the large-scale availability of ammonia as a chemical fertilizer has indi-
rectly saved many people from food shortages and perhaps even starvation.

Haber understood and applied many chemical principles to make the com-
mercial production of ammonia possible. Today, the Haber process and modifi-
cations of it are still used (Figure 1).

How Much Is Too Much?

Earlier we discussed the need to supply excess amounts of reactants to ensure
that the desired chemical reaction can go to completion. We often use excess
reagents in everyday situations where a little may be sufficient, but more may be
better. When we wash our laundry, for example, we may use a little extra deter-
gent to make sure our clothes are completely rid of dirt. When we nourish our
crops, we may use a little extra fertilizer to make sure that we reap the largest har-
vest possible. Is there any harm in using a little excess? In the case of fertilizers, it
seems that a little excess can accumulate to a large excess, with accompanying
consequences.

As we learned in our discussion of the Haber process, fertilizers supply
nitrogen to the soil. Nitrogen is needed for plant growth, and nitrates are the
main source of this element for higher plants. Bacteria in the soil convert atmos-
pheric nitrogen into nitrites (NO2

–), which in turn are converted into nitrates
(NO3

–). The nitrates are released into the soil, where they are absorbed by the
roots of the plants and incorporated into organic nitrogen compounds for use in
other parts of the plant.

However, nitrates are in short supply in most soils, so farmers and gardeners
add synthetic chemical fertilizers to their soil. The manufacture of these fertil-
izers has become a multimillion-dollar industry that employs many chemists and
technologists, producing millions of tonnes of nitrogen-rich chemicals.
Homeowners and farmers use huge quantities of these fertilizers, and the unused
excess amounts are readily washed from the soil and from roadways by rain and
irrigation into ground water, rivers, and lakes. In areas of intensive agriculture,
or where a waterway collects effluent from several communities, the fertilizer not
taken up by the crop plants is proving harmful to local ecosystems.

This problem was brought to light by the plight of the Mississippi River in
the United States. A study showed that 25% of all fertilizer applied in the states
of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri is washed off farm fields
into the upper Mississippi River. In addition to the substantial damage to the
environment, the financial costs of dredging the river, habitat preservation, and
the loss of excess applied fertilizer are enormous.

You might think that a little excess fertilizer would do no harm to the rivers
and lakes, and would even nourish the plant life in those environments. In fact,
the opposite takes place. Once in a lake, the nitrates do what they were intended
to do: stimulate plant growth. When the concentration of nitrates is high, how-
ever, it encourages rapid growth of plants and algae on the surface of the water.



214 Chapter 5

When the algae die and decay, the decomposing bacteria consume large quanti-
ties of dissolved oxygen from the water, depriving fish and other oxygen-
dependent organisms; and the overnourished growth on the water surface
becomes susceptible to insect and disease invasion. Entire habitats covering huge
areas have been destroyed by the nutrient runoff that forms a sludge at the
bottom of waterways.

To address the problem of what to do about nutrient runoff, groups of
researchers have proposed some form of government initiative to regulate the
amount of fertilizers used by farmers and homeowners. Many groups have spe-
cial interests in this proposal:

• City officials are concerned about the cost and safety of the water supply.
• Environmentalists are concerned that the contamination of the water by

nutrient runoff is upsetting the balance of natural resources, which will
affect the long-term survival of these ecosystems.

• Representatives from the tourism industry, whose livelihood depends on
fishing and boating, are concerned about lost revenue resulting from con-
tamination of natural resources.

• Others are concerned about the amount of money poured into the manu-
facture of fertilizers, money that could be better spent in other ways, such
as on land management and wildlife preservation.

• Farmers cannot calculate exact amounts of fertilizers needed, nor can they
predict weather conditions that cause runoff from the soil. Excess fertilizers
are necessary for maximizing yield and ensuring a successful harvest, par-
ticularly in Canada’s short growing season.

• Farmers also feel that regulating the amount of chemical fertilizer applied
only partially addresses the problem. Excess nutrients also come from live-
stock manure and from industrial waste. Plant growers should not be tar-
geted for a much wider problem.

• Some government officials believe that any regulation would be difficult to
enforce. The government does not regulate the amount of gasoline we use
in our cars or the number of cigarettes we smoke, both of which produce
pollutants. Rather, governments should encourage voluntary limits of fer-
tilizer use.

• Others insist that setting up regulatory systems to monitor and enforce
limits of use would be a very costly endeavour. The money can be better
spent in other ways, such as on land management and wildlife preservation.

As you can see, the issue is not cut-and-dried.

5.3 Balancing Nuclear Equations
So far in this unit, we have been discussing chemical reactions in which the
bonds that are broken and formed are between atoms or ions. In this section, we
will discuss nuclear reactions, in which the changes involved are within the
nucleus of an atom. The particles in the nucleus—protons and neutrons—are
called nucleons. Of all energy changes, nuclear reactions involve the greatest
quantities of energy. Energy changes in nuclear reactions are a result of potential
energy changes as bonds between the nucleons are broken or formed.

Based on empirical evidence, scientists classify nuclear reactions into four
types:

• radioactive decay
• artificial transmutation
• fission
• fusion

For each of these nuclear reactions, balanced nuclear equations can be
written. But since the changes occur within the nucleus, when we balance a
nuclear equation only the nucleons are represented.

Radioactive Decay

As you learned in Chapter 1, certain atoms are radioactive: the unstable nucleus
spontaneously decomposes. When this happens it is said to have decayed, or
undergone radioactive decay (Figure 1). Depending on the type of particle
emitted, radioactive decay is alpha decay or beta decay. In each case, a more stable
nucleus results, and extra energy is given off as gamma rays.

Quantities in Chemical Equations 217

When a nucleus undergoes a change that changes the number of protons, its
identity is necessarily changed. It is no longer the same element. This change in
the identity of a nucleus is called a transmutation. For example, the radioisotope
uranium-238 contains 92 protons and 146 neutrons. It spontaneously decom-
poses into two fragments.

The uranium-238 atom loses a helium-4 nucleus, leaving a fragment with 90
protons and 144 neutrons, a total of 234 nucleons. Atoms with 90 protons are
thorium atoms; therefore, a thorium-234 atom is formed. In other words, ura-
nium has been transmuted to thorium. The other particle emitted, the helium-4
nucleus, is called an alpha particle (Figure 3); a stream of alpha particles is called
an alpha ray, and the process in which alpha particles are emitted is called alpha
decay. Alpha particles carry a 2+ charge, which is usually not shown in nuclear
equations.

Notice in the nuclear equation above that the sums of the atomic numbers
on both sides of the equation are the same (92 = 90 + 2). The sums of the mass
numbers on both sides of the equation are also the same (238 = 234 + 4). Since
no protons or neutrons are created or destroyed in a nuclear reaction, the atomic
numbers and mass numbers in nuclear equations are always balanced.

Some smoke detectors contain a small
amount of the radioisotope americium-241,
which emits alpha particles. An electric
alarm is connected to a pair of electrodes,
and the air in the space between the elec-
trodes is ionized by the alpha particles,
allowing a small current to flow. In the event
of a fire, smoke particles enter the space
between the electrodes and absorb the radia-
tion-induced ions, thus interrupting the cur-
rent flow. An electronic sensor in the alarm
circuitry responds to the stoppage of current
by triggering the alarm.

Some unstable nuclei may spontaneously emit a negatively charged electron,
called a beta particle. A stream of beta particles is called a beta ray, and this type
of radioactive decay is called beta decay. An electron is represented by –1

0e: the
mass of an electron is shown as zero because it is exceedingly small and therefore
negligible compared to the mass of nucleons, and the electron has a charge of 1–.
When we follow the uranium-238 alpha decay further, we see that the resultant
thorium-234 nucleus is itself unstable. It undergoes beta decay and is transmuted
to a protactinium-234 nucleus (Figure 4):

Notice in the nuclear equation above that the sums of the atomic numbers
(234 = 234 + 0) and the mass numbers (90 = 91 – 1) remain the same on both
sides of the equation. In this case, the thorium nucleus seems to have gained a proton,
although the total number of protons and neutrons remains constant at 234.
In effect, some scientists believe, one of the neutrons in the thorium-234 nucleus
has transformed into a proton (1111p) and an electron at the moment of decay.
Thus, the electron emitted did not originally reside in the nucleus because elec-
trons are not found in nuclei. Rather, it was created by the nuclear reaction:

1p + –1

0e

In alpha decay, a more stable nucleus is produced by decreasing the mass of
a heavy nucleus, and 42He particles are emitted. In beta decay, a more stable
nucleus is produced by conversion of a neutron into a proton, and –1

0e particles
are emitted. In both cases, high-energy electromagnetic radiation is given off as
gamma rays, the energy emitted when the nucleons reorganize into more stable
arrangements. Gamma rays are represented as 00g—zero mass and zero charge—
because this radiation changes neither the atomic number nor the mass number
of a nucleus. Generally, gamma rays are not shown when writing nuclear equa-
tions just as released heat energy is often absent from chemical equations. A sum-

Artificial Transmutation

A nucleus can also change its identity in another way, called artificial transmuta-
tion. In an artificial transmutation, a nucleus is struck by a neutron or by another
nucleus. The symbol for a neutron is 10n, indicating that it has no charge and a
mass number of 1. To show an example of an artificial transmutation, say a 
chlorine-35 nucleus being struck by a neutron, the nuclear equation would be

35
17Cl + 

1
0n →

35
16S + 

1
1p

In this collision, a sulfur-35 nucleus and a proton, a hydrogen-1 nucleus, are
produced. Notice again that the sums of the atomic numbers (17 + 0 = 16 + 1)
and the mass numbers (35 + 1 = 35 + 1) are balanced in the equation.

The process of artificial transmutation can be used to produce atoms with a
specified number of protons and neutrons. For example, researchers may require
an atom with 15 protons and 15 neutrons for a medical application. They choose
what particles to use for both the nucleus to be bombarded and the particles to
do the bombarding to make the desired atom. The particles used to bombard a
nucleus must be travelling at very high speeds in order to overcome the electro-
static repulsion between them and the target nucleus. This is accomplished by
machines called particle accelerators, which use magnetic and electric fields, for
example, the TRIUMF cyclotron at the University of British Columbia
(Figure 6).

Fission

Another important nuclear reaction is fission. When a uranium-235 nucleus
undergoes fission, it absorbs a neutron and splits into two smaller nuclei. In the
process, two or three neutrons are also given off. Notice in the nuclear equation
below that the atomic numbers and mass numbers are again balanced on both
sides of the equation:

235
92 U + 

1
0n →

141
56Ba + 

92
36Kr + 3

0n 

Nuclear fission reactions release tremendous amounts of energy. The reac-
tion requires the absorption of one neutron, but three neutrons are produced.
These neutrons will encounter other uranium-235 nuclei and cause more fission.
A chain reaction results, and huge quantities of energy are released instanta-
neously. Nuclear fission reactions provide the energy for nuclear power gener-
ating stations, such as the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station (Figure 7).

Fusion

The nuclear reactions that occur in the Sun are important to us because they
supply the energy that sustains life on Earth (Figure 8). There are many different
nuclear reactions taking place in the Sun, as in other stars. In one of the main
reactions, four hydrogen atoms fuse, producing one helium atom. This type of
reaction—light atoms combining to form heavier atoms—is called fusion. A
fusion reaction releases enormous amounts of energy, more energy than is
released in a fission reaction:

Direct solar radiation provides the energy
required for green plants to produce food and
oxygen daily. Indirectly, solar energy is also
the source of energy from winds, water, and
fossil fuels. According to current theory,
fossil fuels are the remains of plants and ani-
mals that originally depended on sunlight for
energy. Fossil fuels are therefore considered
a stored form of solar energy.



222 Chapter 5

Fusion reactions require positively charged nuclei to combine; to do this
they must collide at sufficiently high speeds to overcome their mutual repulsion.
Thus, fusion can only take place at the extremely high temperatures needed to
achieve these speeds, such as in the Sun and other stars, approximately 20 million
Celsius degrees. However, scientists and engineers are researching the possibility
of fusion of two isotopes of hydrogen for use in nuclear fusion reactors on Earth.

5.4 Calculating Masses of Reactants
and Products

Whether we are baking cookies in the kitchen or manufacturing fertilizers in a
factory, we need to be able to calculate the quantity of reactants needed to pro-
duce a certain quantity of product. In industry, a manufacturer needs to know
how much raw material to buy to make the products ordered by its customers. An
extraction metallurgist needs to know the amount of ore needed to produce a cer-
tain amount of pure metal. A car manufacturer needs to know the amount of pol-
lutant that will be produced in the exhaust gases in order to design an efficient
system to deal with the problem. In this section, we will apply the mole concept
from Chapter 4 to balanced chemical equations to make quantitative predictions.

To predict masses of reactants and products, we always begin with a balanced
equation for the reaction. Then we use the mole ratios given by the coefficients in
the equation and convert the relationships to masses as needed. If a reactant or
product is a gas, the amount in moles can also be converted to volume if desired,
using mole–volume conversion techniques that you will learn in Chapter 9.

224 Chapter 5

The procedure for calculating the masses of reactants or products in a chem-
ical reaction is called gravimetric stoichiometry. This term is quite a mouthful
but easily understood simply by taking one word at a time: gravimetric refers to
mass measurement, and stoichiometry refers to the relationships between the
quantities of reactants and products involved in chemical reactions. In general,
in using gravimetric stoichiometry, we look at the mole ratios in balanced equa-
tions and use them to predict masses required or produced.

Let’s consider the synthesis reaction that occurs when zinc metal is heated
with sulfur, S8(s) (Figure 1).

8 Zn(s) + S8(s) → 8 ZnS(s)

As the balanced equation indicates, 8 mol of zinc reacts with 1 mol of sulfur
to produce 8 mol of zinc sulfide. Suppose that we wish to predict the mass of ZnS
that would be produced from 1.00 g of Zn(s). First, we convert the mass (1.00 g)
of Zn(s) into the amount in moles. Then we use the mole ratio given in the equa-
tion and predict the amount in moles of ZnS(s) that is prescribed by the mole
ratio. Finally, we convert the predicted amount in moles of ZnS into mass.

We begin by writing the balanced equation and writing the mass of Zn(s) and
the molar masses of Zn(s) and ZnS(s) beneath their formulas:

8 Zn(s) + S8(s) → 8 ZnS(s)
1.00 g

65.38 g/mol 97.44 g/mol

Next we convert the mass (1.00 g) into amount in moles (65.38 g/mol):

nZn = 1.00 g� × �6

8 Zn(s) + S8(s) → 8 ZnS(s)
1.00 g

65.38 g/mol 97.44 g/mol

0.0153 mol

Now we use the mole ratio given in the equation. The mole ratio prescribes 8 mol
of ZnS(s) for each 8 mol of Zn(s), a 1:1 ratio. Therefore,

nZnS = 0.0153 mol Zn� × �

are 0.0153 mol produced, we convert to mass:

The mass of zinc sulfide produced by the reaction of 1.00 g of zinc with sulfur is

least certain value, 1.00 g. As you can see, it is possible to predict the mass of
product without actually conducting the experiment.

This stoichiometric procedure can also be extended to determine the
number of molecules (N) that have reacted or are produced. For example, if
20.0 g of butane, C4H10(g), is completely burned in a lighter, how many molecules
of carbon dioxide are produced? We begin again with writing the chemical equa-
tion for this combustion, with the mass of butane beneath its formula:

2 C4H10(g) + 13 O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 10 H2O(g)

20.0 g

The most rigorous test of any scientific concept is whether or not it can be used
to make accurate predictions. If the prediction is shown to be valid, then the con-

the concept may be judged unacceptable.

The purpose of this lab exercise is to test the validity of the stoichiometric
method. To do so, we will use the percentage difference between an experimental

5.5 Calculating Limiting and Excess
Reagents

When reactants in a chemical reaction are mixed together, the quantities that
react are determined by the mole ratios in a balanced equation for the reaction.
It is important to know the minimum quantities of each reactant needed for a
desired quantity of product. Generally, industrial processes and laboratory pro-
cedures are designed so that one of the reactants is used as the limiting reagent
and the other reactants are used in slight excess.

Using gravimetric stoichiometry, we can now calculate the exact quantities
of reactants needed for a reaction. It is also possible, therefore, to calculate the
quantities needed for a reactant to be present in excess. As a general guideline, an
excess of 10% should be sufficient to ensure that the limiting reagent is com-
pletely consumed.

Let’s look at the reaction of methane, CH4(g), burning in sufficient oxygen to
produce carbon dioxide and water according to the following equation:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)

If we are burning 2.0 mol of CH4(g), how much O2(g) would be needed? The
mole ratio in the balanced equation tells us that the ratio of CH4:O2 = 1:2.
Therefore, 2.0 mol of CH4(g) would require 2.0 mol × 2 = 4.0 mol of O2(g).

To provide excess oxygen, we would add 10% excess (0.4 mol) and so pro-
vide 4.4 mol of oxygen.

Since we cannot directly measure moles, we can convert the amount in
moles into mass. The molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of
4.4 mol of O2(g) is equal to 4.4 mol × 32.00 g/mol, which is 140.00 g of O2(g).

Which Reagent Is Limiting?

Suppose we have, in a container, 2.5 mol of methane and 6.0 mol of oxygen gas.
Is one of the reactants limiting? If so, which one? This information is important
if we wish to know the amount of product that will be formed, and we can use
gravimetric stoichiometry to find the answer.

The balanced equation for the combustion of methane to form carbon
dioxide and water is given below:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)

To determine which reactant is the limiting one, we can restate the question
as: How many moles of oxygen does 2.5 mol of methane need? We then compare
that amount to the amount we have and see if there is enough.

According to the mole ratio in the balanced equation, 2.5 mol of methane
would need 5.0 mol of oxygen because the mole ratio of methane:oxygen is 1:2.
Do we have at least 5.0 mol of oxygen? Yes, we do. In fact, we have 6.0 mol of
oxygen, more than enough. Therefore, we can conclude that oxygen is not the
limiting reagent; methane is (Figure 1).

We could also have taken a similar approach in the other direction: we could
have restated the question as: How many moles of methane does 6.0 mol of
oxygen need? We would have come out with the same answer. Let’s follow the
calculations to confirm this.

According to the mole ratio in the balanced equation, 6.0 mol of oxygen
would need 3.0 mol of methane because the mole ratio of methane:oxygen is 1:2.
Do we have at least 3.0 mol of methane? No, we don’t. We have only 2.5 mol of
methane. This means that when all of the 2.5 mol of methane is used up, no more
product can be formed. Only 5.0 mol of oxygen will have been used, and the
remaining 1.0 mol of unused oxygen will not have any methane to react with.
Therefore, methane is limiting the amount of product formed. We conclude, as
before, that methane is the limiting reagent in this system (Figure 2).

Once we have determined which reagent is limiting, we can use gravimetric
stoichiometry to predict the amount of any product formed in the reaction. The
amount of limiting reagent is always the deciding factor in the amount of prod-
ucts formed. The amount of the excess reagent includes some quantities that will
be left over, unreacted, and therefore cannot be used to predict other quantities
in a reaction.

investigation is similar in design to Lab Exercise 5.5.1. However, you will design
the experiment, including determining which reagent you use is in excess, and
conduct it as well, obtaining your own evidence. Complete a report that includes
a Prediction, the Materials list, Procedure, Evidence, Analysis, and Evaluation

5.6 The Yield of a Chemical Reaction
In all of the predictions of masses of reactants and products so far, we have based
our calculations on the balanced equations for the chemical reactions. We must
remember that the quantities that we calculate in our predictions are theoretical
quantities. They are the quantities of products that should be produced,
according to the numbers in the balanced equation. They are not necessarily the
quantities that we actually get when we carry out the reaction, mixing the reac-
tants and collecting the products.

The amount of product that is obtained in a chemical reaction is called the
yield. It may be measured in mass or in moles. The amount of product that we
predict we should get by stoichiometric calculations using the balanced equation
is called the theoretical yield. When we carry out the reaction, whether it is in a
school or in an industrial laboratory, the amount of product that is obtained and
measured at the end of the procedure is called the actual yield.

Often the actual yield in a chemical reaction turns out to be less than the 
theoretical yield. Theoretically, each and every atom, ion, and molecule proceeds
through the reaction according to the balanced equation and is accounted for
and measured in one of the products. In actual practice, there are several reasons
why all of the materials do not end up in the collected product. The most
common loss of product is as a result of experimental procedures, such as in
transferring solutions, filtering precipitates, and splattering during heating.
These losses can be reduced by improving technical skills or the equipment used,
or by reducing the number of steps in the experimental design.

The poor yield could also be due to impurities in the reagents used.
Chemicals come in a wide variety of grades, or purities (Figure 1). Some low-
purity or technical grades may be only 80% to 90% pure; if this factor is not
accounted for in the amount of reactant used, the actual yield will again be less
than the theoretical yield. Impurities may also be a result of other processes. For
example, metals such as magnesium readily react with air to form a layer of metal
oxide on the surface. These impurities are included in the mass of reactants but
do not proceed to form the products collected, thus causing the actual yield to
differ from the theoretical yield.

Another cause of low yield is a side reaction, forming other than the desired
product. When magnesium ribbon is heated in a crucible, it reacts with oxygen
in the air to form magnesium oxide. However, air contains a mixture of gases,
including nitrogen. A side reaction may occur in which some of the magnesium
reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. If the product collected is pre-
sumed to be magnesium oxide, but in fact also contains the nitride, the actual
yield will be different from the theoretical yield. To correct this discrepancy, addi-
tional steps can be introduced to convert all products to the desired product.

In yet other cases, the conditions may not be ideal for the reaction to go to
completion. This happens when, as more and more products are formed, the
reverse reaction occurs, in which the products of the reaction become the reac-
tants of the reverse reaction. A certain amount of the products are thus being
used up at the same time that they are being produced. In such cases, the actual
yield is the amount of product present and is always less than the theoretical
yield. To minimize these losses, the conditions for the reaction may need to be
changed to allow the reaction to go to completion.

A comparison of the actual yield and the theoretical yield gives an indication
of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. We can calculate this efficiency as a 
percentage yield, by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield:

yield: the amount of product that is
obtained in a chemical reaction

theoretical yield: the amount of product
that we predict will be obtained, calculated
from the equation

actual yield: the amount of product that is
actually obtained at the end of a procedure

Figure 1

Chemicals come in a wide variety of grades
(purities). The purity of a chemical can signifi-
cantly affect experimental results in a chem-
ical reaction.

percentage yield: the ratio, expressed as
a percentage, of the actual or experimental
quantity of product obtained (actual yield) to
the maximum possible quantity of product
(theoretical yield) derived from a gravimetric
stoichiometry calculation

The spruce budworm survives harsh Canadian
winters by producing an antifreeze protein
that lowers the freezing point of its body
fluids. Scientists are interested in the pos-
sible use of these antifreeze proteins to help
preserve organs at low temperatures prior to
transplant operations. To increase the yield of
these antifreeze proteins, biochemists have
isolated the spruce budworm gene respon-
sible for making the proteins and incorpo-
rated it into bacteria. Since bacteria grow
rapidly, they are ideal “factories” for mass
production of the selected proteins.

Procedure

1. Measure a mass of 2.00 g of the copper salt, to 0.01 g, and dissolve in 50 mL
of water in a beaker.

2. Fold the aluminum foil lengthwise to make a strip 2 cm × 8 cm. Coil the
strip loosely to fit into the copper chloride solution in the beaker, making
sure that the strip is entirely immersed.

3. Heat the beaker gently on the hot plate for 5 min or longer, until all blue
colour in the solution has disappeared. Continue heating gently for
another 5 min. Allow to cool.

4. Use the forceps to shake loose all copper formed on the aluminum foil.
Carefully transfer the copper to a weighed beaker and rinse the copper
with water.

5. Pour off as much of the rinse water as possible. Spread the copper on the
bottom of the beaker.

6. Cover the beaker containing the wet copper with a watch glass and gently
heat the beaker to drive off the water. Reduce heat if the copper begins to
turn black.

Yield in Industrial Chemical Reactions

In industrial applications, it is important for manufacturers of a product to
achieve as close to 100% yield as possible (Figure 3). The chemists or engineers
must first determine the percentage yield of the operation and analyze all aspects
of the process to look for ways of improving efficiency. This may require
changing the conditions of the reaction, such as the temperature or pressure,
which would in turn change the final equilibrium conditions of the reaction. It
may require changing some steps in the procedure to reduce loss due to inade-
quate equipment or poor technique. The final decision will rest on an analysis of
the costs of the changes required to improve the yield as well as the increased

profit from an improved yield. The decision may also depend on whether byprod-
ucts or unused reactants can be recycled or used in other profitable processes.

A model case of striving for maximum yield is that of the synthesis of
ibuprofen, an analgesic (painkiller) sold under several brand names, such as
Motrin and Advil (Figure 4). The company that manufactures ibuprofen, BHC
Company, researched and refined its chemical process to produce a more effi-
cient synthesis, creating less waste and fewer byproducts.

The traditional industrial synthesis of ibuprofen was developed in the 1960s
and involved a six-step process that resulted in large quantities of unwanted chem-
icals that needed to be disposed of. Even if the percentage yield was at an accept-
able level, the yield of products from raw materials was low due to the reactions
used in the experimental design. In this process, dubbed the “brown” process, 40%
of the total atoms present in the reactants were recovered in the desired product.

In 1991, a new three-step process was implemented that dramatically
reduced the quantities of waste chemicals produced and increased to 77% the
recovery of atoms from reactants to desired product. The shorter “green” process
also offered the advantage of producing larger quantities of ibuprofen in less
time and with less capital expenditure. These improvements not only increased
profitability for the company, but benefited the environment also by reducing the
need to dispose of millions of kilograms of waste materials.

What is the difference between science and technology? Are they the same thing?
How are they related? Science is the study of the natural world to describe, pre-
dict, and explain changes and substances; technology encompasses the skills,
processes, and equipment required to make useful products or to perform useful
tasks. Sometimes technology is a practical application of science. However, often
a certain technology existed long before the scientific principles behind it were
understood. In this section we will look at the technology of glassmaking and
how a scientific understanding of chemical reactions led to the industrial pro-
duction of one of its key ingredients.

Glass is formed by heating a mixture of sand, sodium carbonate (soda), and cal-
cium oxide (lime) to a high temperature—1425°C to 1600°C, depending upon the
exact composition—at which point the mixture takes on a molten (liquid) state.
The sand provides silicon dioxide (silica), which makes up the largest percentage of
the mixture. Sodium carbonate lowers the temperature at which the sand will melt,
and calcium oxide makes the glass strong and water-resistant. The percentage com-
position of this glass mixture determines the properties of the resultant glass. When
cooled, the molten glass mixture becomes a “supercooled” liquid that retains its
liquid shape as a solid. Glass making is known to have begun in Egypt about 5000
years ago, long before chemical formulas and reactions were understood, a case of
technology preceding scientific knowledge. In Canada, glass making dates back to
the 1800s, with the production of mostly industrial glassware, such as lantern and
streetlight globes, lenses for railway and ship lanterns, and telephone line insulators.

The advances in atomic theory and the development of systematic quantita-
tive analysis in the early 1800s brought with them an understanding of chemical
formulas and equations. The application of chemical analysis and calculations
led to improved properties of glass as well as the establishment of industrial
chemical processes (Figure 1).

The LeBlanc Process

At the beginning of this chapter we talked about the LeBlanc process used during
the 1700s and 1800s to produce sodium carbonate. Not only was the process
inefficient but it was harmful also to the environment. The LeBlanc process
begins with the reaction of salt and sulfuric acid, releasing hydrogen chloride:

useful products. Chemical engineers now work in many areas of
science, especially in industry. They design and develop indus-
trial processes to make different consumer goods; they scale up
laboratory experiments into industrial-size operations; they ana-
lyze data using electronics and computers. They are also respon-
sible for the design of an efficient and safe chemical plant that
protects the natural environment. Overall, a chemical engineer is
a versatile problem-solver. 

Research some specific fields in chemical engineering and
the university courses that lead to a degree in chemical engi-
neering. If possible, interview a chemical engineer to learn more
about a career in this field. Prepare a report on your findings.

scale industrial supply of raw materials such

the French chemist Jean-Baptiste-André
Dumas (1800–1884) showed that soda-lime-
silica glass was most durable when the mass
ratio of the three was 1:1:6, a ratio that is
still used in modern soda-lime-silica glass.

the 1800s, with the production of mostly industrial glassware, such as lantern and
streetlight globes, lenses for railway and ship lanterns, and telephone line insulators.

The advances in atomic theory and the development of systematic quantita-
tive analysis in the early 1800s brought with them an understanding of chemical
formulas and equations. The application of chemical analysis and calculations
led to improved properties of glass as well as the establishment of industrial
chemical processes (Figure 1).

The LeBlanc Process

At the beginning of this chapter we talked about the LeBlanc process used during
the 1700s and 1800s to produce sodium carbonate. Not only was the process
inefficient but it was harmful also to the environment. The LeBlanc process
begins with the reaction of salt and sulfuric acid, releasing hydrogen chloride:

useful products. Chemical engineers now work in many areas of
science, especially in industry. They design and develop indus-
trial processes to make different consumer goods; they scale up
laboratory experiments into industrial-size operations; they ana-
lyze data using electronics and computers. They are also respon-
sible for the design of an efficient and safe chemical plant that
protects the natural environment. Overall, a chemical engineer is
a versatile problem-solver. 

Research some specific fields in chemical engineering and
the university courses that lead to a degree in chemical engi-
neering. If possible, interview a chemical engineer to learn more
about a career in this field. Prepare a report on your findings.

Science in Glass Making 

The development of systematic quantitative
chemical analysis in the early 19th century,
followed by chemical formulas and equa-
tions, contributed a great deal to the large-
scale industrial supply of raw materials such
as soda ash, used in glass making. In 1830,
the French chemist Jean-Baptiste-André
Dumas (1800–1884) showed that soda-lime-
silica glass was most durable when the mass
ratio of the three was 1:1:6, a ratio that is
still used in modern soda-lime-silica glass.

Answer

1. 2 mol

heat

NaCl(s) + H2SO4(l) → NaHSO4(s) + HCl(g)

The residue that remains is mostly a mixture of the sodium hydrogen sulfate and
any unreacted sodium chloride. Further heating produces sodium sulfate and
more hydrogen chloride gas:

heat

NaHSO4(s) + NaCl(s) → Na2SO4(s) + HCl(g)

The sodium sulfate is then mixed with limestone (CaCO3) and coal and
heated to a high temperature. Complex changes occur, and the net result is sum-
marized in the equation below:

heat

Na2SO4(s) + CaCO3(s) + 2C(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CaS(s) + 2 CO2(g)

The desired sodium carbonate is extracted from this mixture by leaching with
warm water, followed by filtration and evaporation.

Let’s take a look at the chemical reactions and conditions needed in the
LeBlanc process and identify some of its problems. Hydrogen chloride, an air
pollutant that has a devastating effect on the environment, is generated as a
product in two of the reactions. Each step in the process requires heat; the cost
of fuel used in the heating is considerable. In addition to fuel, a reactant in the
final step is coal, making the process unhealthy and dirty. The residue that is left
at the end of the process is an insoluble mixture that has no commercial use or
value. Overall, the LeBlanc process was an expensive and environmentally
harmful procedure, although at the time, the pollution was not considered a
problem because this “dirty” process provided a plentiful source of alkali for
soap-making. Personal hygiene became more affordable, resulting in a consider-
able positive impact on public health in Europe.

It took further pure scientific research to provide the knowledge necessary to
develop a new technology capable of improving the yield and addressing the
environmental concerns in this industrial process.

Practice

Understanding Concepts

1. Using the equations of the chemical reactions in the LeBlanc process,
calculate (in moles) the amount of the air pollutant hydrogen chloride
released for each mole of sodium carbonate produced.

2. Explain why the LeBlanc process was expensive.

3. Suggest reasons why air pollutants were not a cause for concern in
the 17th and 18th centuries, but are a major concern now.

The Solvay Process

In 1865 Ernest Solvay (Figure 2), a Belgian chemist, began to perfect a new
process, the Solvay process, for the production of sodium carbonate, and in 1867
Solvay’s process was installed for the first time in his small factory in Belgium.

Since the LeBlanc process was so firmly established, the new Solvay process
did not gain immediate acceptance. However, the cost of the new process was
one-third the cost of the old LeBlanc process, so Solvay processing plants were
eventually built in every major industrialized country. The wide use of his inven-



Quantities in Chemical Equations 247

5.7

tion brought Solvay a great deal of money, much of which he channelled into
charitable work in Brussels.

The overall, or net, reaction in the Solvay process, involving calcium car-
bonate and sodium chloride, is one that does not occur spontaneously at room
temperature:

CaCO3(s) + 2 NaCl(aq) → Na2CO3(aq) + CaCl2(aq)

Imagine adding chalk to a salt solution—no reaction occurs. How then can
this reaction be implemented industrially to produce large quantities of sodium
carbonate? Solvay’s design involved an indirect route with a series of interme-
diate reactions. His major breakthrough includes a reaction between ammonium
hydrogen carbonate and sodium chloride that at first glance seems improbable:

NH4HCO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → NH4Cl(aq) + NaHCO3(s)

What Solvay discovered by experimentation is that in cold water ammonium
chloride has a higher solubility than sodium hydrogen carbonate. As a result,
sodium hydrogen carbonate can be separated out of the solution by crystalliza-
tion. This separation by solubility allows the NaHCO3(s) to be separated and sold
as baking soda or to be decomposed into Na2CO3(s) as washing soda.

The ingenuity of Solvay’s design becomes apparent when you write out the
reactions and see that all of the intermediate products are recycled as reactants in
other reactions. Nothing is left as a byproduct except calcium chloride, which
today is sold as road salt and as a drying agent (desiccant). See for yourself in the
following questions.

Practice

Understanding Concepts

4. Write and balance the reaction equations for the Solvay process from
the word equations below:
(a) Limestone, CaCO3(s), is decomposed by heat to form calcium

oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide.
(b) Carbon dioxide reacts with aqueous ammonia and water to form

aqueous ammonium hydrogen carbonate.
(c) In the same vessel, the aqueous ammonium hydrogen carbonate

reacts with brine, NaCl(aq), to produce aqueous ammonium chlo-
ride and solid baking soda, NaHCO3(s).

(d) Heating the separated baking soda decomposes it into solid
washing soda, water vapour, and carbon dioxide.

(e) The first of two recycling reactions involves the reaction of lime,
CaO(s), with water to produce slaked lime, Ca(OH)2(s).

(f) Next, the slaked lime is added to the aqueous ammonium chlo-
ride (an intermediate product) to produce ammonia, aqueous cal-
cium chloride, and water.

(g) Write the net (overall) reaction for the Solvay process.

5. Intermediate products are produced partway through a process and
become reactants in a later reaction. Cross out all intermediate prod-
ucts in the reaction equations you have written for the Solvay
process. Don’t be concerned about quantities of reactants and prod-
ucts. What you have left should combine to give you the net unbal-
anced reaction for the Solvay process.

6. Raw materials are the materials that are consumed in the net reac-
tion. What are the raw materials for the Solvay process? Where are

tical problems of large-scale commercial pro-
duction of sodium carbonate with his

with carbon dioxide. He also founded several
scientific institutes and conferences which, in
turn, contributed to the development of theo-
ries on quantum mechanics and atomic struc-
ture.

these raw materials obtained? What makes these materials suitable
for a large-scale chemical process?

7. The primary products and the byproducts of a chemical process
depend on how marketable the products are. What are the primary
products and byproducts of the Solvay process?

8. What intermediate product in the Solvay process is highly mar-
ketable? What are some consequences of removing this intermediate
from the system of reactions?

9. Resources other than chemical and technological resources are
required for most chemical processes. What additional natural
resources are needed for the Solvay process?

10. Large quantities are used in newer processing plants that are built on
what is called a “world scale” to produce quantities for international
distribution. Why do you think chemical plants are being built on an
increasingly large scale?

The Cost of Technology

As we said at the beginning of this section, technology encompasses the skills,
processes, and equipment required to make useful products or to perform useful
tasks. When technology is applied in industry, these skills, processes, and equip-
ment pose considerable cost. Since the underlying objective of any industry is to
make a profit, the most inexpensive process is naturally preferred.

However, the most inexpensive process is not necessarily the most desirable
environmentally. We learned that the LeBlanc process was costly not only in
terms of the cost of raw materials and fuel, but also in terms of the damage to the
environment and that, even though the newer Solvay process was more efficient
economically and more environmentally friendly, it took many years before it
was adopted. What if the Solvay process had been more expensive? Would it still
have replaced the LeBlanc process? If becoming more environmentally friendly
means making less profit, the loss of profit will likely be passed on to the con-
sumer in the form of higher prices. Are we willing to pay the cost? 

We do indeed find these choices presented to us on store shelves. Paper prod-
ucts, for example, are made from wood pulp that must be bleached with chlorine
or compounds containing chlorine, all of which are harmful to the environment.
We can buy unbleached paper products, such as brown coffee filters, but we may
be surprised to find that they cost more than the bleached variety. For other
items, such as paper towels or envelopes, we may pay more for the products made
from recycled materials than for those made from new materials. At the service
station, we may choose to fill up our cars with gasohol, a blend of gasoline and
alcohol. The alcohol is made from organic materials such as corn, so the need for
nonrenewable fossil fuels is reduced. The combustion of alcohol also produces
smaller amounts of pollutants such as carbon monoxide and sulfur oxides. You
may find, however, that the cost of gasohol is slightly higher than that of gasoline
in the price per litre; gasohol also has a lower fuel efficiency.

There are several reasons why these choices cost more. A major obstacle in
the way of changing technologies is the large start-up costs of building new
plants, buying new equipment, and restructuring existing processes. Other rea-
sons may be the low consumer demand for the “green” product, limiting pro-
duction to quantities that are less than optimal in efficiency. Industries may be
willing or may be required to develop and implement environmentally friendlier
technology. Are the higher prices charged to consumers justified? Should we as
consumers share the costs of these new technologies?



Quantities in Chemical Equations 249

5.7

Consider the following points:

• Without consumers buying their products in sufficient quantities, indus-
tries would not be able to stay in business. The consumer ultimately deter-
mines what products are marketed and should be willing to share the cost
of better technology.

• If industries are regulated to adhere to environmental standards, the costs
of which are not recovered in increased price, they may move to other
countries where restrictions are less stringent. This results in no benefit to
the global environment and a loss of jobs to other countries.

• It is the role of governments and industries to ensure that the best tech-
nology is used to protect the environment. For the consumer, paying for
essentials such as food and shelter is more crucial than supporting indus-
tries that are making large profits.

• Rather than developing expensive new technologies, we should change our
consumer attitudes and reduce the quantities of harmful substances used.
For example, instead of driving, we should walk to school or shopping
malls wherever possible; instead of disposable paper towels, we should use
cloth towels.

gies even if new processes offer the possibility of economic or other
benefits.

12. In what way do consumers have input in determining the chemical
processes used by industry?

Who should pay the costs of improved technology?
Working in small groups, choose one industry (e.g., pulp and paper,

nickel smelting, gasohol) and research different companies in that
industry to see what efforts have been made to develop environmen-
tally friendly solutions. Your research should include the following com-
ponents:

• the costs involved in changing to the new technology
• the consumer demand or support for the new technology

Quantitative Analysis of a Reaction
The active ingredient in baking soda is sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO3(s).
Upon heating, this ingredient releases bubbles of a gas that give baked goods a
light, spongy consistency (Figure 1). Your task is to use your knowledge and skills
of quantitative analysis to identify the decomposition reaction of sodium
hydrogen carbonate from five possibilities. In each of the possible reactions listed
below, one or more gases are produced and a solid remains:

1. sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium (solid), water vapour, carbon
monoxide gas, oxygen gas

2. sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium carbonate (solid), water vapour,
carbon dioxide gas

3. sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium hydroxide (solid), carbon dioxide
gas

4. sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium oxalate, Na2C2O4(s), water vapour,
oxygen gas

5. sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium oxide (solid), water vapour, carbon
dioxide gas

bonate and then identify the chemical reaction that has taken place from the five
reactions given above. In order to do so, you will design and perform an experi-

“I take great joy in being a scientist, not least because I

was diagnosed as an epileptic when I was just 15, in

Grade 10. I had been told that because of the epilepsy I

could never go to university, much less study science.

However, I did succeed in science. Being an epileptic is

one of the major reasons that I directed my research and

studies in the direction that I did. In studying aqueous

solutions, I was not dealing with chemicals that were

explosive and dangerous to handle. My studies also fit

my inclinations. I love to think in three dimensions and

contemplate how crystals form

from solutions, and also how they

dissolve. As a university researcher,

I have the freedom to study what I

am interested in, whereas in an

industrial position I would be told

what to research. My current focus

is on solutions formed from 

crystalline aluminum hydroxide,

which is amphoteric (it can act as

an acid or a base). In acid solutions,

its chemistry is important for envi-

ronmental reasons; in basic solu-

tions it is important in the

extraction of aluminum from ore.”

The Nature and
Properties of Solutions
Is there such a thing as pure, natural water? Certainly it can’t be found in the
oceans. In Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s classic poem, The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner, written in 1798, an old seafarer describes the desperation of becalmed
sailors, drifting without fresh water under the fierce sun, driven mad with thirst:

Water, water, everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink.

Drinking the water of the sea, which is rich in dissolved solutes, can be fatal.
Today, seagoing ships carry distillation equipment to convert salt water into
drinking water by removing most of those solutes.

Fresh water from lakes and rivers, which we depend on for drinking,
cooking, irrigation, electric power generation, and recreation, is also impure.
Even direct from a spring, fresh water is a solution that contains dissolved min-
erals and gases. So many substances dissolve in water that it has been called “the
universal solvent.” Many household products, including soft drinks, fruit juices,
vinegar, cleaners, and medicines, are aqueous (water) solutions. (“Aqueous”
comes from the Latin aqua for “water,” as in aqueduct and aquatics.) Our blood
plasma is mostly water, and many substances essential to life are dissolved in it,
including glucose and carbon dioxide.

The ability of so many materials to dissolve in water also has some negative
implications. Human activities have introduced thousands of unwanted sub-
stances into water supplies. These substances include paints, cleaners, industrial
waste, insecticides, fertilizers, salt from highways, and other contaminants. Even
the atmosphere is contaminated with gases produced when fossil fuels are
burned. Rain, falling through these contaminants, may become acidic. Learning
about aqueous solutions and the limits to purity will help you understand sci-
ence-related social issues forming around the quality of our water.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• describe and explain the proper-
ties of water, and demonstrate an
understanding of its importance
as a universal solvent;

• explain the formation of solutions
involving various solutes in water
and nonpolar solutes in non-
aqueous solvents;

solution, electrolyte, concentra-
tion, standard solution, stock
solution, and dilution;

• solve solution concentration prob-
lems using a variety of units;

• develop the technological skills
for the preparation of solutions;

• determine qualitative properties
of solutions;

• provide examples of solutions
involving all three states;

• provide consumer and commer-
cial examples of solutions,
including those in which the con-
centration must be precisely
known;

• explain the origins of pollutants in
natural water.

6.1 Defining a Solution
Many of the substances that we use every day come packaged with water. We buy
other substances with little or no water, but then mix water with them before use.
For example, we may purchase syrup, household ammonia, and pop with water
already added, but we mix baking soda, salt, sugar, and powdered drinks with
water. Most of the chemical reactions that you see in high school occur in a water
environment. Indeed, most of the chemical reactions necessary for life on our
planet occur in water.

Because so many substances dissolve in it, water is often referred to as the
universal solvent. Of course, this is an exaggeration. Not all things dissolve in
water. Imagine if they did; we would not be able to find a container for water.

Before restricting our study to mixtures involving water, we will review the
more general definition and types of a solution.

Solutions

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of substances composed of at least one
solute and one solvent. Liquid-state and gas-state solutions are clear (trans-
parent)—you can see through them; they are not cloudy or murky in appear-
ance. Solutions may be coloured or colourless. Opaque or translucent (cloudy)
mixtures, such as milk, contain undissolved particles large enough to block or
scatter light waves. These mixtures are considered to be heterogeneous.

It is not immediately obvious whether a clear substance is pure or is a mix-
ture, but it is certainly homogeneous. Homogeneous mixtures in the liquid state
and the gas state are always clear with only one phase present. If you were to do
a chemical analysis of a sample of a homogeneous mixture (i.e., a solution), you
would find that the proportion of each chemical in the sample remains the same,
regardless of how small the sample is. This is explained by the idea that there is a
uniform mixture of particles (atoms, ions, and/or molecules) in a solution.
Empirically, a solution is homogeneous; theoretically, it is uniform at the atomic
and molecular level.

Both solutes and solvents may
be gases, liquids, or solids, pro-
ducing a number of different com-
binations (Table 1). In metal alloys,
such as bronze or the mercury
amalgam used in tooth fillings, the
dissolving has taken place in liquid
form before the solution is used in
solid form. Common liquid solu-
tions that have a solvent other than
water include varnish, spray furni-
ture polish, and gasoline. Gasoline,
for example, is a mixture of as many
as 400 different hydrocarbons and
other compounds (Figure 1). These
substances form a solution—a
homogeneous mixture at the molecular level. There are many such hydrocarbon
solutions, including kerosene (a Canadian-invented fuel for lamps and stoves),
and turpentine (used for cleaning paintbrushes). Most greases and oils will dis-
solve in hydrocarbon solvents.

solution: a homogeneous mixture of sub-
stances composed of at least one solute and
one solvent 

homogeneous mixture: a uniform mix-
ture of only one phase

solute: a substance that is dissolved in a
solvent (e.g., salt, NaCl)

solvent: the medium in which a solute is
dissolved; often the liquid component of a
solution (e.g., water)

Misleading Labelling

Milk is sometimes labelled as “homoge-
nized,” meaning that the cream is equally
distributed throughout the milk. This use of
the word does not match the chemistry defi-
nition of homogeneous. Using the strict
chemistry definition, milk is not a homoge-
neous mixture, but a heterogeneous mixture.
Milk is not a solution.

The Nature and Properties of Solutions 267

6.1

Other examples of liquids and solids dissolving in solvents other than water
include the many chemicals that dissolve in alcohols. For example, solid iodine
dissolved in ethanol (an alcohol) is used as an antiseptic (Figure 2). Aspirin
(acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) dissolves better in methanol (a poisonous alcohol)
than it does in water, for example, when doing chemical analyses. Of course, it
should never be mixed with alcohol when ingested. Some glues and sealants
make use of other solvents: acetic acid is used as a solvent of the components of
silicone sealants. You can smell the vinegar odour of acetic acid when sealing
around tubs and fish tanks.

The chemical formula representing a solution specifies the solute by using its
chemical formula and shows the solvent by using a subscript. For example,

NH3(aq) ammonia gas (solute) dissolved in water (solvent)

NaCl(aq) solid sodium chloride (solute) dissolved in water (solvent)

I2(al) solid iodine (solute) dissolved in alcohol (solvent)

C2H5OH(aq) liquid ethanol (solute) dissolved in water (solvent)

By far the most numerous and versatile solutions are those in which water is
the solvent (Figure 3). Water can dissolve many substances, forming many
unique solutions. All aqueous solutions have water as the solvent and are clear
(transparent). They may be either coloured or colourless. Although water solu-
tions are all different, they have some similarities and can be classified or
described in a number of ways. This chapter deals primarily with the character-
istics of aqueous solutions.

Properties of Aqueous Solutions

Compounds can be classified as either electrolytes or nonelectrolytes.
Electrolytes are solutes that form solutions that conduct electricity. At this point
we will restrict ourselves to compounds in aqueous solutions. Compounds are
electrolytes if their aqueous solutions conduct electricity. Compounds are non-
electrolytes if their aqueous solu-
tions do not conduct electricity.
Most household aqueous solutions,
such as fruit juices and cleaning
solutions, contain electrolytes. The
conductivity of a solution is easily
tested with a simple conductivity
apparatus (Figure 4) or an ohm-
meter. This evidence also provides a
diagnostic test to determine the
class of a solute—electrolyte or
nonelectrolyte. This very broad
classification of compounds into
electrolyte and nonelectrolyte cate-
gories can be related to the main
types of compounds classified in
Chapter 2. Electrolytes are mostly
highly soluble ionic compounds
(e.g., KBr(aq)), including bases such as
ionic hydroxides (e.g., sodium hydrox-
ide, NaOH(aq)). Most molecular

electrolyte: a compound that, in an
aqueous solution, conducts electricity

aqueous solution, does not conduct electricity

268 Chapter 6

compounds (e.g., ethanol, C2H5OH(aq)) are nonelectrolytes, with the exception
of acids. Acids (e.g., nitric acid, HNO3(aq)) are molecular compounds that, in
aqueous solution, conduct electricity.

Another empirical method of classifying solutions uses litmus paper as a test
to classify solutes as acids, bases, or neutral substances. Acids form acidic solu-
tions, bases form basic solutions, and most other ionic and molecular com-
pounds form neutral solutions (Table 2).

In this investigation you will design and carry out a chemical analysis of four
compounds (calcium chloride, citric acid, glucose, and calcium hydroxide) to
find out which is which. Complete the Experimental Design and Materials
section of the report. You will use the diagnostic tests discussed so far: the con-
ductivity test and the litmus test. After conducting your tests, complete the
Analysis and Evaluation sections.

Question

Which of the white solids labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4 is calcium chloride, citric acid,
glucose, and calcium hydroxide?

Experimental Design

You may use litmus paper and the conductivity apparatus. Like all such tests, the
conductivity and litmus tests require control of other variables. For example, the
temperature of the solution and the quantity of dissolved solute must be kept the
same for all substances tested, to allow valid analysis of any evidence collected.
(a) In a short paragraph, plan your tests for this experiment, including inde-

pendent, dependent, and important controlled variables.
(b) Write a Procedure in which you will use your tests, including safety precau-

tions. (If necessary, refer to MSDS information for the four solids.) Have
your Procedure approved by your teacher.

(c) Prepare a list of all materials, including chemicals and equipment. Note
that this experiment can easily be done on a small scale using a spot or well
plate. Be sure to include safety and disposal equipment.

Explaining Water Mixtures

How can we explain the properties of solutes and solvents? We could use models,
such as the concepts of molecules, atoms, electrons, and bonds or forces. In
Chapter 2 we used the concept of intramolecular forces (i.e., covalent bonds) to
describe, explain, and predict the chemical formulas of molecular substances. We
use another concept to explain the physical properties of substances: the concept
that there are forces holding molecules close to each other. These forces act
between molecules, and so are called intermolecular forces.

Now we have the challenge of explaining why some substances dissolve in a
given solvent, but others do not. Let us start with aqueous solutions. Why do only
some chemicals dissolve in water? Why are some chemicals mutually attracted to
one another? 

Molecular Substances in Water

We have gathered evidence and made some generalizations about which sub-
stances, including water, contain polar molecules (Chapter 2). Let us now find
out if polarity has an effect on solubility. For example, we could test the hypoth-
esis that polar substances dissolve in polar substances and nonpolar solutes in
nonpolar solvents (“like dissolves like”). In other words, do like-polarity sub-
stances dissolve in each other?

The prefix “inter” means “between,” as

The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that molecular sub-
stances with similar polarity dissolve in each other—“like dissolves like.”

Complete the Materials and Procedure sections. Be sure to include all nec-
essary safety precautions and equipment. When these have your teacher’s
approval, carry out the investigation, record your Evidence, and complete the
Analysis and Evaluation sections of the report.

Question
Do water (H2O(l)), ethylene glycol (C2H4(OH)2(l)), toluene (C7H8(l)), and min-

eral oil (a mixture of hydrocarbons, CxHy(l)) dissolve in each other (Figure 2)?

Hypothesis/Prediction

According to the hypothesis that like-polarity substances dissolve in each other,
water and ethylene glycol will dissolve in each other, but not in toluene or min-
eral oil, and toluene and mineral oil will dissolve in each other. The reasoning
behind this prediction is that water and propanol contain polar molecules while
toluene and mineral oil contain nonpolar molecules.

Experimental Design

Water, ethylene glycol, toluene, and
mineral oil are mixed in pairs
(Figure 3). The independent vari-
able is the kind of chemicals used
(polar or nonpolar); the dependent
variable is whether the substances
dissolve; and the controlled vari-
ables are volume, temperature, and
mixing.

The Effects of Polarity and Hydrogen Bonds

Ethylene glycol, a chemical with polar molecules, has a high solubility in water.
Chemists have a theoretical explanation for this: Polar solute molecules are sur-
rounded and suspended in solution by polar solvent molecules (Figure 4).

How do chemists explain the extraordinary solubility in water of solutes
with hydrogen bonding capability, such as ethylene glycol? In Chapter 2, you saw
that the higher than expected boiling points of some pure substances could be
explained by hydrogen bonding. Recall that any substance with a hydrogen (H)
atom covalently bonded to a N, O, or F atom can “hydrogen bond” to its own
molecules to increase the intermolecular forces beyond the strength of London
and dipole–dipole forces. Also recall that water has two hydrogen atoms bonded
to an oxygen atom, which, in turn, has two lone-pairs of electrons to take part in
hydrogen bonding with other water molecules.

Now consider that, when water is the solvent, there is a potential for solutes
with N, O, or F lone-pairs or with a H—N, H—O, or H—F bond to form
hydrogen bonds with water. For example, ammonia, NH3(g), has a very high sol-
ubility in water (as in household ammonia). Ammonia fulfills both criteria: It
has a lone pair of electrons that could accept a positively charged hydrogen for
sharing; and it has three hydrogens to share with the two lone-pairs on a nearby
water molecule (Figure 5). When multiple hydrogen bonding is possible, we
would predict an especially high solubility. More importantly, if both the solute
and the solvent have H—N, H—O, or H—F bonds, then evidence suggests that
the attractions and the solubility are high.

The explanation for the high solubility of ammonia is both logical and con-
sistent, and can be tentatively accepted on that basis. The next test for any con-
cept is its ability to predict an outcome. Can our concept for explaining solubility
successfully predict solubilities in an experiment?

We have created a concept concerning the solubilities of molecular substances:
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents, and nonpolar solutes dissolve in non-
polar solvents. In this exercise, we will use this concept and the information in
Table 2 and Figure 6 (page 276) to predict the solubilities of a variety of sub-
stances in water. The procedure has been carried out, and the observations of sol-
ubilities are presented as a table of evidence. Complete the Prediction, Analysis,
and Evaluation sections of the report.

Ionic Compounds in Water

Water is the most important solvent on Earth. The oceans, lakes, rivers, and rain
are aqueous solutions containing many different ionic compounds and a few
molecular solutes. As you know, there are some ionic compounds that dissolve
only very slightly in water, such as limestone (calcium carbonate) buildings and
various other rocks and minerals. Nevertheless, many more ionic compounds
dissolve in water than in any other known solvent.

Why are ionic compounds so soluble in water? The key to the explanation
came from the study of electrolytes. Electrolytes were first explained by Svante
Arrhenius who was born in Wijk, Sweden, in 1859. While attending the
University of Uppsala, he became intrigued by the problem of how and why
some aqueous solutions conduct electricity, but others do not. This problem had
puzzled chemists ever since Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday experi-
mented over half a century earlier by passing electric currents through chemical
substances.

Faraday believed that an electric current produces new charged particles in
a solution. He called these electric particles ions (a form of the Greek word for
“to go”). He could not explain what ions were, or why they did not form in solu-
tions of substances such as sugar or alcohol dissolved in water.

In 1887 Arrhenius proposed a new hypothesis: that particles of a substance,
when dissolving, separate from each other and disperse into the solution.
Nonelectrolytes disperse electrically neutral particles throughout the solution. As
Figure 7 shows, molecules of sucrose (a nonelectrolyte) separate from each other

tral particles in solution, agrees with the evi-
dence that a sucrose solution does not
conduct electricity.



278 Chapter 6

and disperse in an aqueous solution as individual molecules of sucrose sur-
rounded by water molecules.

But what about the conductivity of solutions of electrolytes? Arrhenius’
explanation for this observation was quite radical. He agreed with the accepted
theory that electric current involves the movement of electric charge. Ionic com-
pounds form conducting solutions. Therefore, according to Arrhenius, electri-
cally charged particles must be present in their solutions. For example, when a
compound such as table salt dissolves, it dissociates into individual aqueous ions
(Figure 8). The positive ions are surrounded by the negative ends of the polar
water molecules, while the negative ions are surrounded by the positive ends of
the polar water molecules. Dissociation equations, such as the following exam-
ples, show this separation of ions.

Notice that the formula for the solvent, H2O(l), does not appear as a reactant
in the equation. Although water is necessary for the process of dissociation, it is
not consumed and hence is not a reactant. The presence of water molecules sur-
rounding the ions is indicated by the subscript (aq).

Explaining Nonaqueous Mixtures

We now have an explanation for the solubility of ionic compounds (electrolytes)
and molecular substances (nonelectrolytes) in water. The next question is, why
do nonpolar solutes (e.g., grease) dissolve in nonpolar solvents (e.g., kerosene)?
These chemicals do not show evidence of either polar molecules (dipoles) or
hydrogen bonding. The third intermolecular force that we can look to for an
explanation is the London (dispersion) force. London forces are weak intermol-
ecular forces, and can explain the relatively low boiling points of nonpolar and
non-hydrogen bonding compounds. Similarly, they can explain why these same
compounds dissolve in each other to form solutions (Figure 9).

Water—“The Universal Solvent”

Seventy-five percent of Earth is covered with water—both liquid and solid. All
forms of life, including animals and plants, depend upon the life-supporting
fluid called water. Water dissolves so many more substances than any other liquid
that it is not surprising that water is often referred to as the “universal solvent.”
This success as a solvent is due to three features of water molecules: their small
size; their highly polar nature; and their considerable capacity for hydrogen
bonding.

The Nature and Properties of Solutions 281

6.3 Solution Concentration
Most aqueous solutions are colourless, so there is no way of knowing, by looking
at them, how much of the solute is present in the solution. As we often need to
know the amount of solute in the solution, it is important that solutions be
labelled with this information. We use a ratio that compares the quantity of
solute to the quantity of the solution. This ratio is called the solution’s concen-
tration. Chemists describe a solution of a given substance as dilute if it has a rel-
atively small quantity of solute per unit volume of solution (Figure 1). A
concentrated solution, on the other hand, has a relatively large quantity of solute
per unit volume of solution.

In general, the concentration, c, of any solution is expressed by the ratio

concentration �

Percentage Concentration

Many consumer products, such as vinegar (acetic acid), are conveniently labelled
with their concentration ratios expressed as percentages (Figure 2). A vinegar
label listing “5% acetic acid (by volume)” means that there are 5 mL of pure
acetic acid dissolved in every 100 mL of the vinegar solution. This type of con-
centration is often designated as % V/V, percentage volume by volume, or per-
centage by volume.

Another common concentration ratio used for consumer products is “per-
centage weight by volume” or % W/V. (In consumer and commercial applica-
tions, “weight” is used instead of “mass,” which explains the W in the W/V label.)
For example, a hydrogen peroxide topical solution used as an antiseptic is 
3% W/V (Figure 2). This means that 3 g of hydrogen peroxide is in every 100 mL
of solution.

Very Low Concentrations 

In studies of solutions in the environment, we often encounter very low concen-
trations. For very dilute solutions we choose a concentration unit to give reason-
able numbers for very small quantities of solute. For example, the concentration
of toxic substances in the environment or of chlorine in a swimming pool is usu-
ally expressed as parts per million (ppm, 1:106) or even smaller ratios, such as
parts per billion (ppb, 1:109) or parts per trillion (ppt, 1:1012). These ratios are
used for liquid and solid mixtures and are a special case of the weight by weight
(W/W) ratio. One part per million of chlorine in a swimming pool corresponds
to 1 g of chlorine in 106 g of pool water. Because very dilute aqueous solutions are
very similar to pure water, their densities are considered to be the same: 1 g/mL.
Therefore, 1 ppm of chlorine is 1 g in 106 g or 106 mL (1000 L) of pool water,
which is equivalent to 1 mg of chlorine per litre of water. Small concentrations
such as ppm, ppb, and ppt are difficult to imagine, but are very important in envi-
ronmental studies and in the reporting of toxic effects of substances (Table 1).

We can express the parts per million (ppm) concentration using a variety of
units. Choose the one that matches the information given in the example you are
calculating. For aqueous solutions,
1 ppm = 1 g/106 mL

= 1 g/1000 L
= 1 mg/L
= 1 mg/kg
= 1 µg/g

Molar Concentration

Chemistry is primarily the study of chemical reactions, which we communicate
using balanced chemical equations. The coefficients in these equations represent
amounts of chemicals in units of moles. Concentration is therefore communi-
cated using molar concentration. Molar concentration, C, is the amount of
solute in moles dissolved in one litre of solution.

molar concentration = 

C = 

The units of molar concentration (mol/L) come directly from this ratio. The
symbol C denotes a molar quantity, just as M is molar mass, but m is mass.

Molar concentration is sometimes indicated by the use of square brackets.
For example, the molar concentration of sodium hydroxide in water could be
represented by [NaOH(aq)].

culate a quantity of solute or solution. Any of these calculations may involve per-
centage concentrations, very low concentrations, or molar concentrations. When
we know two of these values—quantity of solute, quantity of solution, and con-
centration of solution—we can calculate the third. Because concentration is a
ratio, a simple procedure is to use the concentration ratio (quantity of
solute/quantity of solution) as a conversion factor. This approach parallels the
one you followed when using molar mass as a conversion factor.

Suppose you are a nurse who needs to calculate the mass of dextrose,
C6H12O6(s), present in a 1000-mL intravenous feeding of D5W, which is a solu-
tion of 5.0 % W/V dextrose in water. The conversion factor you need to use is the
mass/volume ratio.

mC6H12O6

In some calculations you may want to find the quantity of solution, in which
case you will have to flip the ratio to quantity of solution/quantity of solute. This
is then the appropriate conversion factor.

For example, what volume of 30.0% W/V hydrogen peroxide solution can be
made from 125 g of pure hydrogen peroxide? You know that the answer must be
greater than 100 mL because 125 g is greater than 30.0 g (the quantity in
100 mL). Notice how the units cancel to produce the expected volume unit,
millilitres, when we use the volume/mass ratio.

Thinking about the quantity given and the concentration ratio helps to
ensure you are calculating correctly. This method also works for other concen-
tration ratios.

The quantities of solute and solution may be expressed as mass and volume
respectively, so the appropriate conversion ratio would be a mass/volume ratio.

Mass, Volume, and Concentration Calculations

While the mole is a very important unit, measurements in a chemistry laboratory
are usually of mass (in grams) and of volume (in millilitres). A common chem-
istry calculation involves the mass of a substance, the volume of a solution, and
the molar concentration of that solution. This type of calculation requires the
use of two conversion factors—one for molar mass and one for molar concen-
tration. Calculations using molar mass are just like the ones you did in Unit 2.
For example, a chemical analysis requires 2.00 L of 0.150 mol/L AgNO3(aq). What
mass of silver nitrate solid is required to prepare this solution? First, you must
determine the amount of silver nitrate needed, in moles.

6.4 Drinking Water
We land mammals have a very biased view of our planet: we think almost exclu-
sively about its solid surface. The fact is, over 70% of Earth is covered with a
dilute aqueous solution averaging about 4 km deep. That represents an
absolutely staggering amount of water, and it is useful to us for a great number
of things—except drinking. Only about 0.02% of the water on Earth is fresh
water in lakes and rivers, and about 0.6% more is ground water soaked into the
soil and porous rock of the planet’s crust.

In Canada we are extremely fortunate to have access to the most abundant
supply of fresh water in the world. Our natural water supply can be divided into
two types: surface water and ground water. Our surface water is in the Great
Lakes, the thousands of smaller lakes, and the rivers, streams, and springs that
make Canada such a wonderful place to live. Our ground water is a huge, hidden
underground resource made up of thousands of aquifers. All of these bodies of
water are potential sources of drinking water.

292 Chapter 6

Water is continually on the move: flowing downhill, moving between surface
water and ground water, and following the hydrologic cycle (Figure 1). Given this
abundant natural resource of water, it seems ironic that we have to be concerned
about the state of our drinking water, but this is indeed the case. Canada’s pop-
ulation is very concentrated, with more and more people living in urban or sub-
urban areas in the southern portion of the country than elsewhere. Where people
live in high concentrations, human activity almost invariably has an effect on the
water supply.

Of course, even completely natural, uncontaminated water contains many
substances besides water molecules: living organisms, suspended particles, and a
wide range of naturally occurring dissolved chemicals from the surrounding
rocks and minerals. Calcium, magnesium, and sodium are the most common
cations, while hydrogen carbonate, sulfate, and chloride are the most common
anions. The concentration of naturally occurring ions varies widely from one
body of water to another. For example, the ion concentration is 48 mg/L in Lake
Superior, and 329 mg/L in the Grand River in southern Ontario.

Water Contamination 

The advent of people, particularly large numbers of people living in fairly small
areas, has changed the quantities and types of substances that find their way into

precipitation

evaporation

condensation

Water is returned to bodies 
of water in streams, rivers, 
and aquifers.

The hydrologic cycle provides the fresh water

municipalities.



The Nature and Properties of Solutions 293

the water. We call these substances, collectively, contaminants, and classify them
into three categories: biological (including viruses, bacteria, and algae), physical
(suspended particles that make the water appear “dirty”), and chemical (all dis-
solved substances, including metals, manufactured chemicals, and even artifi-
cially high levels of natural minerals).

Water has always contained contaminants, and always threatened the health of
those who depend on it. So why do we need to be more concerned about contami-
nation, and particularly chemical contamination, now than in the past? Quite simply,
we are producing, transporting, and dumping larger quantities of a greater variety of
chemicals now than at any time in the past.While biological contamination was most
likely a leading cause of death and illness in earlier centuries, the 20th century’s
Industrial Revolution has placed a completely different set of stresses on our water
supply: chemical contaminants. We are now using chemicals in every aspect of our
lives, from growing our food to running our hand-held computers. And not all of
these chemicals are staying neatly where we put them (Figure 2). They leak, they run
off, they leach out, and they are dumped, and they end up in our water.

The environment does have a certain tolerance for pollution. Many sub-
stances, if present only in low concentrations, can be broken down naturally. But
in the quantities released and discarded by today’s society, the overload of
nitrates, phosphates, and industrial wastes eventually puts the aquatic ecosystem
out of balance, leading to low oxygen levels. Fortunately, however, given enough
time, this damage is reversible.

Sometimes the damage caused by pollutants in our waterways, including PCBs,
dioxins, heavy metals, and some pesticides, cannot be reversed. These persistent
chemicals are not broken down by natural processes. Even in tiny amounts some of
these substances can cause serious harm. PCBs and dioxins are carcinogenic (cancer-
causing), and heavy metals have been linked to impaired brain development in ver-
tebrates. Such toxic chemicals seriously contaminate the Great Lakes, the Fraser River,
and the St. Lawrence River. We can be certain that they are also in our ground water.

The most common sources of water pollution are listed in Table 1. Others
include industrial leaks or spills; highway or railway accidents resulting in spills;
byproducts from coal-fired power plants, old coal gasification sites, and petro-
leum refineries; underground waste disposal; and contaminants in rain, snow,

In this stream, pollution is visible, but this is
not always the case.

and dry atmospheric fallout. The possible dangers of the various pollutants are
listed in Table 2.

We use both surface water and ground water as sources for drinking water.
Large towns and cities generally use surface water for the huge volumes of water
they supply to people and industries. Smaller towns and more isolated rural set-
tlements are more often supplied by municipal wells drilled down into a suitable
aquifer. Farms, cottages, and rural homes may be supplied by their own small
private wells.

As a source of drinking water, ground water has traditionally been consid-
ered safer than surface water because of its filtration through soil (removing the
suspended solids and many of the dissolved chemicals) and its long residence
underground (killing the majority of microorganisms that cannot survive for
more than a few days outside a host organism).

Water obtained privately, whether from wells or from nearby surface water,
may be completely untreated. The quality of the water from these wells is the
responsibility of the well’s owner. However, all municipal supplies of drinking
water have to be monitored and tested regularly, both before and after treatment,
to ensure their safety.

All levels of government in Canada have some degree of responsibility in
ensuring the safety of Canada’s drinking water, resulting in a patchwork of poli-
cies. The provinces and territories are responsible for setting and enforcing stan-
dards to ensure adequate drinking water treatment, while municipal
governments have the responsibility for supplying safe water to their residents as
an essential public service. Federal–provincial water quality guidelines list the
maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) of a large number of chemicals in
our treated drinking water (Table 3). Water treatment procedures set up by
municipal public utilities commissions must conform to these water quality
guidelines. Chemical technicians at water-testing labs assess water quality by
measuring the amounts of various substances in the water.

heavy metals interfere with brain and nerve development in vertebrates

mineral solids make water cloudy, inhibiting aquatic plant growth

nitrates and encourage plant growth, sometimes resulting in algal blooms causing 
phosphates deoxygenation of water

trations of cadmium, lead, and mercury, how much of each metal
would an average person consume in a year?

Water Treatment

What water treatment procedures are in place to achieve the increasingly high
quality that we demand of our drinking water? Water from a natural source is often
treated in a series of steps (Figure 3, page 296) to make it potable, or safe to drink.
The most serious concern is safeguarding health, so disinfecting to kill harmful
microorganisms is the most important part of the treatment process. Besides safety,
the consumer is generally most concerned about appearance, taste, and odour.

1. Collection: The raw water is pumped
in from intake pipes deep in the surface
water, or from a well. Large particles
and debris are removed by travelling
screens as the water enters the
treatment plant.

2. Coagulation, Flocculation, and Sedimentation:
Coagulation is the process of rapidly mixing
chemicals known as coagulants with the water to
make the small particles in the water clump together.
Flocculation is the gentle mixing to form a light, fluffy,
flocculent (wool-like, or jelly-like) precipitate, called a
floc. During sedimentation the floc settles very slowly,
sinking and carrying suspended particles with it and
thereby clearing the water.

3. Filtration: In this stage, the
remaining floc, other chemical and
physical impurities, and most of the
biological impurities (bacteria, etc.)
are removed. The water flows by
gravity through efficient filters made
up of layers of sand and anthracite
(carbon), and is then collected via
an under-drain system.

7. Fluoridation: A small amount of
fluoride is added to drinking water
in some areas, as it makes the
enamel layer of teeth more
resistant to decay.

6. Softening: If the water is initially very
hard, it may be treated with sodium
carbonate and calcium hydroxide
(called a soda-lime process) or a
phosphate to reduce water hardness
by precipitating the calcium and
magnesium ions.

8. Post-chlorination: A final chlorine
disinfection treatment kills any remaining
microorganisms, and pH is adjusted to
be slightly basic (since even slightly
acidic water will corrode metallic pipes,
creating structural and health problems).
Sometimes additional chlorine is added
in a process known as superchlorination
when the levels of bacteria are high.

5. Aeration: Other substances (such
as air, ozone, or oxygen, “activated”
charcoal, ammonia, chlorine dioxide,
or potassium permanganate) may be
mixed with the water to further reduce
taste and colour problems.

4. Disinfection: Chlorine is added to kill microorganisms
and to react with most organic molecules present.
This first addition of chlorine to the raw water as
it enters the plant is known as pre-chlorination.
Alternative disinfectants include ozone (O3(g)) or
chlorine dioxide (ClO2(g)), ammonia (NH3(aq)),
potassium permanganate (KMnO4(aq)), and even
ultraviolet light. There are many kinds of technology
used for disinfecting water. The destruction of
disease-causing organisms is the most important step
in the water treatment process.

9. Ammoniation: Ammonia is added at the end
of the treatment process to stabilize the
chlorine so that it remains dissolved in the
treated water for longer periods of time,
keeping the water safe during its long trip
through the distribution system. Ammoniation
also prevents minute amounts of chlorine from
evaporating out of your drinking water causing
smells and associated tastes.

Figure 3

Although not all water treatment plants use all of these steps, all municipal water goes through some form of treatment.



The Nature and Properties of Solutions 297

When the water has passed through all these processes, it is then pumped out
through the distribution system to industries, homes, and businesses.

This is, of course, an expensive process (Figure 4). Municipalities tend to try
to find the least expensive way of achieving safe water, so occasionally water is
distributed that is insufficiently treated.

6.4

Figure 4

Safe water treatment involves dealing with
huge volumes daily with no margin of error
allowable.

This simple activity lets you see what happens during the settling part of
the water treatment process. You will use a widely available chemical
known as alum, often sold at pharmacies. The term alum used commer-
cially refers to one of the hydrates of: aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3(s);
sodium aluminum sulfate, NaAl(SO4)2(s); potassium aluminum sulfate,
KAl(SO4)2(s); or ammonium aluminum sulfate, NH4Al(SO4)2(s). The con-
tainer may or may not specify which compound—and it doesn’t really
matter for purposes of this activity. The substance is relatively harmless,
and may be safely disposed of down the sink with lots of water.

Materials: alum, soil, household ammonia, 3 drinking glasses, 3 
teaspoons 

• Place 5 mL (about a level teaspoonful) of alum into a glass nearly
full of local tap water at room temperature. Stir gently until solid
crystals are no longer visible. Add a teaspoon of household
ammonia and stir. What do you observe?

• Repeat with a second glass, but this time also add about 5 mL of
soil to the glass before adding the alum.

• Stir only a teaspoon of soil into the water in the third glass.
• Place the glasses where they will not be disturbed and record your

observations over the next several hours (preferably overnight, or a
full 24 h).

eral hours? Explain these differences.

Simulated Water Treatment



298 Chapter 6

In Canada we have historically had small populations sharing huge water
resources, so traditionally we have treated all our municipal water supplies, even
though less than 2% of the daily water use of a typical Canadian is for drinking.
This may change in the future. In fact, sales of bottled water for home consump-
tion are increasing dramatically, indicating that Canadians are starting to think
seriously about different water quality requirements. Perhaps it is not necessary
that the water we use to wash our cars or water our gardens be as clean as the
water we want to drink, cook in, or use to brush our teeth.

Ontarians received a wake-up call about our drinking water in the spring of
2000. There were unusually heavy rains in the southern part of the province,
causing minor flooding in many areas. The rain saturated the ground, mixing
surface contaminants with the water in the aquifers. In the town of Walkerton
(Figure 5), this situation resulted in contamination of the drinking water, which
turned out to be fatal for seven people and caused serious illness in hundreds
more who suffered with nausea, severe cramps, and bloody diarrhea. The symp-
toms usually cleared in a few days, but about 5% of those affected developed
complications, including kidney failure. The very young and the elderly were
particularly susceptible. For months afterward, residents of Walkerton were
required to boil their drinking water and to add household bleach to water used
for washing hands and dishes.

The events in Walkerton sparked extensive investigations to determine what
happened: what went wrong, who was to blame, and how such a tragedy could
be avoided in the future. The town’s water supply comes from three wells that
draw from the ground water stored in the aquifer lying under the town.
Engineers investigated the flow of ground water in the Walkerton area and estab-
lished that, while it appears that the main problem was with one specific well,
there were pathways to all three wells that would allow contamination to enter.
Indications are that the Walkerton tragedy was due to agricultural runoff from
cattle manure, which often carries bacteria. Usually, impurities are filtered out as
the water percolates down, but it seems likely that this time water carrying a par-
ticularly virulent strain of E. coli bacteria found its way into the aquifer from
which the town’s water supply was drawn. This would not have been tragic had
the town’s water treatment system been working properly. Unfortunately, the
chlorination system was not functioning, and contaminated water was delivered
to all the homes depending on the town water supply. Although routine labora-
tory tests had shown that there were bacteria in the water, this information was
not relayed to the people of Walkerton in time to prevent widespread infection.
What is perhaps even more alarming is that similar contamination and chlori-
nation failure had occurred several times during the previous five years. It seems
that the incident in Walkerton was a disaster waiting to happen.

This unfortunate series of failures, in a system that most of us take for
granted, has raised concerns about the safety of our drinking water. We are
starting to pay more attention to our water, and asking questions about who is
responsible for the quality of water in Canada.

It is clear that we can no longer take safe drinking water for granted. Our water
supply is being polluted and people are becoming sick and dying from unsafe
drinking water. While this has been happening for thousands of years, and is cer-
tainly still the case in many parts of the world, it is a situation that Canadians are
unwilling to accept. Between 1970 and 1990 there was a five-fold increase in water
consumption in Canada, so it is all the more important to consider improvements
to municipal water treatment practices across the country. A major challenge in
designing a better water policy for Canada is balancing the need to regulate and
enforce drinking-water standards with the need to contain treatment costs.

supply raised concerns about the processes

The Walkerton incident prompted a province-wide inspection of water
treatment plants in Ontario. The inspectors found numerous problems,
including substandard wells, insufficient sampling and analysis, prob-
lems with water treatment equipment, underqualified operators, and
poor commmunication between the testing labs and the authorities. 

How can you reduce the chances of your community being supplied
with contaminated drinking water? Working in small groups, research
the current state of the drinking water in your community. Your research
should include the following components:

• the source and quality of the water before it is treated;
• possible sources of contaminants;
• testing standards for safe drinking water;
• treatment standards for municipal water.

(a) Choose one aspect of the delivery of safe water to your tap. How
might it be improved upon? Draft a letter to your local municipality,
commending it on the strong points of its current water delivery 
practice while recommending improvements where you think they

6.5 Solution Preparation
When you mix up a jug of iced tea using a package of crystals and water, you are
preparing a solution from a solid solute (actually, from several solid solutes). But
when you mix the tea from a container of frozen concentrate, you are preparing
a solution by dilution. Scientists use both of these methods to prepare solutions.
In this course you will be preparing only aqueous solutions. The knowledge and
skills for preparing solutions are necessary to complete some of the more com-
plex laboratory investigations that come later in this course.

Preparation of Standard Solutions from a Solid

Solutions with precisely known concentrations, called standard solutions, are
routinely prepared in both scientific research laboratories and industrial
processes. They are used in chemical analysis as well as for the precise control of
chemical reactions. To prepare a standard solution, precision equipment is

ances are used for precise and efficient measurement of mass (Figure 1). For
measuring a precise volume of the final solution, a container called a volumetric
flask is used (Figure 2).

In this activity you will practise the skills required to prepare a standard solution
from a pure solid. You will need these skills in many investigations in this book.

Procedure

1. Calculate the mass of solid copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate needed to pre-
pare 100.0 mL of a 0.5000 mol/L solution.

2. Obtain the calculated mass of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate in a clean,
dry 150-mL beaker.

3. Dissolve the solid in 40 to 50 mL of pure water.

4. Transfer the solution into a 100-mL volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker two
or three times with small quantities of pure water, transferring the rinsings
into the volumetric flask.

5. Add pure water to the volumetric flask until the volume is 100.0 mL.

6. Stopper the flask and mix the contents thoroughly by repeatedly inverting
the flask.

Note: Store your solution for the next activity.

precision a volumetric flask (on the right) is
used. The volumetric flask shown here, when
filled to the line, contains 100.0 mL ± 0.16 mL
at 20°C. This means that a volume measured

(b) Write a laboratory procedure for preparing the potassium per-
manganate solution. Follow the conventions of communication
for a procedure in a laboratory report.

Preparation of Standard Solutions by Dilution

A second method of preparing solutions is by dilution of an existing solution. You
apply this process when you add water to concentrated fruit juice, fabric softener,
or a cleaning product. Because dilution is a simple, quick procedure, it is common
scientific practice to begin with a stock solution or a standard solution, and to add
solvent (usually water) to decrease the concentration to the desired level.

While there are no hard and fast rules, we often describe solutions with a
molar concentration of less than 0.1 mol/L as dilute, while solutions with a con-
centration of greater than 1 mol/L may be referred to as concentrated.

Calculating the new concentration after a dilution is straightforward because
the quantity (mass or amount) of solute is not changed by adding more solvent.
Therefore, the mass (or amount) of solute before dilution is the same as the mass
(or amount) of solute after dilution.

mi � mf or  ni � nf
mi = initial mass of solute

mf = final mass of solute

ni = initial amount of solute (in moles)

nf = final amount of solute (in moles)

Using the definitions of solution concentration (m = vc or n = vC), we can
express the constant quantity of solute in terms of the volume and concentration
of solution.

viCi = vfCf
Ci = initial concentration

Hard-water deposits such as calcium carbonate

rubber gloves and eye protection.

Cf = final concentration

vi = initial volume before dilution

vf = final volume after dilution

This means that the concentration is inversely related to the solution’s
volume. For example, if water is added to 6% hydrogen peroxide disinfectant
until the total volume is doubled, the concentration becomes one-half the orig-
inal value, or 3%.

Any one of the values expressed may be calculated for the dilution of a solu-
tion, provided the other three values are known. (Note that the dilution calcula-
tion for percentage weight by weight (%W/W) will be slightly different because
the mass of solution is used; i.e., msolute = msolutionc.)

Many consumer and commercial products are purchased in concentrated
form and then diluted before use. This saves on shipping charges and reduces the
size of the container—making the product less expensive and more environ-
mentally friendly. Citizens who are comfortable with dilution techniques can live
more lightly on Earth (Figure 5).

volume is 1.000 L. Find the molar concentration of the final, diluted solution.

The dilution technique is especially useful when you need to manipulate the
concentration of a solution. For example, when doing scientific or technological
research, you may want to slow down a reaction that proceeds too rapidly or too
violently with a concentrated solution. You could do this by lowering the con-
centration of the solution. In the medical and pharmaceutical industries, pre-
scriptions require not only minute quantities, but also extremely precise
measurement. If the solutions are diluted before being sold, it is much easier for
a patient to take the correct dose. For example, it’s easier to accurately measure
out 10 mL (two teaspoons) of a cough medicine than it is to measure one-fifth
of a teaspoon, which the patient would have to do if the medicine were 10 times
more concentrated.

The preparation of standard solutions by dilution requires a means of trans-
ferring precise volumes of solution. You know how to use graduated cylinders to
measure volumes of solution, but graduated cylinders are not precise enough
when working with small volumes. To deliver a very precise, small volume of
solution, a laboratory device called a pipet is used. A 10-mL graduated pipet has
graduation marks every tenth of a millilitre (Figure 7). This type of pipet can
transfer any volume from 0.1 mL to 10.0 mL, and is more precise than a gradu-
ated cylinder. A volumetric pipet transfers only one specific volume, but has a
very high precision. For example, a 10-mL volumetric (or delivery) pipet is
designed to transfer 10.00 mL of solution with a precision of ± 0.02 mL. The vol-
umetric pipet is often inscribed with TD to indicate that it is calibrated to deliver
a particular volume with a specified precision. Both kinds of pipet come in a
range of sizes and are used with a pipet bulb.

Figure 6

When diluting all concentrated reagents,
especially acids, always add the concen-
trated reagent to water. When acids are
mixed with water, heat is often produced. If a
large amount of acid is added to a small
amount of water, the water might boil and
spatter the reagent out of the container.
Remember “AAA”: Always Add Acid.

Solubility and Reactions
It is easier to handle a great many chemicals when they are in solution, particu-
larly those that are toxic, corrosive, or gaseous. Both in homes and at worksites,
transporting, loading, and storing chemicals are more convenient and efficient
when the chemicals are in solution rather than in solid or gaseous states. Also,
performing a reaction in solution can change the rate (speed), the extent (com-
pleteness), and the type (kind of product) of the chemical reaction.

Solutions make it easy to
• handle chemicals—a solid or gas is dissolved in water for ease of use or

transportation;
• complete reactions—some chemicals do not react until in a solution where

there is increased contact between the reacting entities;
• control reactions—the rate, extent, and type of reactions are much more

easily controlled when one or more reactants are in solution.

These three points all apply to the liquid cleaning solution in Figure 1. The
cleaning solution is easy to handle, and the fact that it is sold in a spray bottle
adds to its convenience. Spraying a solution is an effective way of handling a
chemical that is dissolved in water. Secondly, the solution allows a reaction to
occur between the cleaning chemicals and the dirty deposit, whereas a pure gas
or solid would not react well with a solid. Thirdly, the manufacturer can control
the rate of the reaction (and thus the safety) by choosing the ideal concentration
of the cleaning solution. Having the chemical in solution rather than in its pure
state increases our ability to handle and control it.

In this chapter we will examine several concepts, including the extent to
which one substance will dissolve in another, and the effect of temperature on
the extent of dissolving. In chemical reactions we often wish to produce a
product that is more or less soluble than the reactants. In fact, this is one of the
most common techniques used for separating chemical substances. This chapter
will help you understand how to do this.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• describe the effect of temperature
on the solubility of solids, liquids,
and gases in water;

• explain hardness of water, its con-
sequences, and water-softening
methods;

• predict combinations of aqueous
solutions that produce precipi-
tates and represent these reac-
tions using net ionic equations;

• describe the technology and the
major steps involved in the purifi-
cation of water and the treatment
of waste water;

• perform qualitative and quantita-
tive analyses of solutions.

2. When dissolving a chemical in water, the rate of dissolving is often con-
fused with the extent of dissolving. How do you speed up the rate of dis-
solving of a solute? How do you know if no more solute will dissolve?

7.1 Solubility
When you add a small amount of pickling salt (pure sodium chloride) to a jar of
water and shake the jar, the salt dissolves and disappears completely. What happens
if you continue adding salt and shaking? Eventually, some visible solid salt crystals
will remain at the bottom of the jar, despite your efforts to make them dissolve. You
have formed a saturated solution—a solution in which no more solute will dis-
solve. We say it is at maximum solute concentration. If the container is sealed, and
the temperature stays the same, no further changes will ever occur in the concen-
tration of this solution. The quantity (mass) of solute that remains undissolved will
also stay the same. The solubility of sodium chloride in water is the concentration
of your saturated solution. The units for solubility and maximum concentration
are therefore the same: usually grams of solute per 100 mL of solvent.You will learn
in this chapter that solubility depends on the temperature, so it is a particular max-
imum concentration value. Every solubility value must be accompanied by a tem-
perature value.

When calculating and using solubility values we have to make one assump-
tion: the solute is not reacting with the solvent.

Solubility of Solids

Every pure substance has its own unique solubility. For example, we can find
from a reference source, such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,
that the solubility of sodium sulfate in water at 0°C is 4.76 g/100 mL. Remember
that this means 4.76 g of solute can be dissolved in 100 mL of water; not that you
will have 100 mL of solution after dissolving 4.76 g of solute. If more than 4.76 g
of this solute is added to 100 mL of water in the container, the excess will not dis-
solve under the specified conditions (Figure 1). The quickest way to see whether
you have a saturated solution is to look for the presence of undissolved solids in
the solution. There are several experimental designs that can be used to deter-
mine the solubility of a solid. For example, the solvent from a measured volume
of saturated solution might be removed by evaporation, leaving the crystallized
solid solute behind—which can then be collected and measured.

Because the solubility of a substance changes with the temperature of the satu-
rated solution, it is sometimes useful to plot graphs of the relationship between
these two variables. A graph gives an instant visual picture of the relationship and
can then be used to determine the solubility at any temperature. A graph of sol-
ubility and temperature of the solution is called a solubility curve.

In this investigation, you will measure the temperature at which the solute
precipitates out of solution, indicating that the solute has reached its maximum
concentration. You will do this for several different concentrations. You will then
use your evidence to create a solubility curve. Complete the Analysis and
Evaluation sections of the lab report.

This activity illustrates the various effects of temperature (and even
some effects of pressure) on solubility. It also highlights an interesting

Solubility in Water—Generalizations and Examples

Scientists have carried out a very large number of experiments as they investi-
gated the effects of temperature on the solubility of various solutes. From the
results of their experiments, they have developed several useful generalizations
about the solubility of solids, liquids, and gases in water. In all cases, we assume
that the solid, liquid, or gas does not react with the solvent, water. The following
list outlines how the solubility of various solutes varies with temperature.

• Solids usually have higher solubility in water at higher temperatures. Figure 2
shows the solubility curves of many ionic compounds. This trend is gener-
ally the same for soluble molecular compounds. For example, sucrose has a
solubility of about 180 g/100 mL at 0°C and 487 g/100 mL at 100°C.

• Gases always have higher solubility in water at lower temperatures. The sol-
ubility of gases decreases as the temperature increases. The relationship
between solubility and temperature is inverse and approximately linear.

• It is difficult to generalize about the effect of temperature on the solubility
of liquids in water. However, for polar liquids in water, the solubility usu-
ally increases with temperature. A prediction of the solubility of liquids
with temperature will not be as reliable as a prediction for solids and gases.

• Some liquids (mostly nonpolar liquids) do not dissolve in water to any
appreciable extent, but form a separate layer. Liquids that behave in this
way are said to be immiscible with water. For example, benzene, gasoline,
and carbon disulfide (which is used in the process of turning wood pulp
into rayon or cellophane) are all virtually insoluble in water.

• Some liquids (such as those containing small polar molecules with
hydrogen bonding) dissolve completely in water in any proportion. Liquids
that behave in this way are said to be miscible with water. For example,
ethanol (in alcoholic beverages), acetic acid (in vinegar), and ethylene
glycol (in antifreeze) all dissolve completely in water.

• Elements generally have low solubility in water. For example, some people
put a lump of sulfur in their dog’s water bowl, to keep the water “fresh.”
The same piece of sulfur can last, apparently unchanged, for years. Carbon
is used in many water filtration systems to remove organic compounds that
cause odours. The carbon does not dissolve in the water passing through it.

• Although the halogens and oxygen dissolve in water to only a very tiny
extent, they are so reactive that even in tiny concentrations they are often
very important in solution reactions.

Of course, there are exceptions to all generalizations. For example, the solu-
bility of lithium carbonate in water actually decreases as the temperature increases.

Practice

6. For any solute, what important condition must be stated in order to
report the solubility? 

7. Sketch a solubility graph showing two lines labelled “solids” and
“gases.” Assume a straight-line relationship and show the generaliza-
tion for the change in solubility of each type of substance with
increasing temperature.

rate layers instead of dissolving

and have no maximum concentration



320 Chapter 7

8. A common diagnostic test for CO2(g) involves the use of a saturated
solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2(aq), historically called lime-
water. Calcium hydroxide has low solubility—but is actually soluble
enough to have a noticeable effect. The solution is easily prepared by
placing a spoonful of solid Ca(OH)2(s) in pure water, and stirring or
shaking for a while. A small amount of the solid dissolves. The
excess solute settles to the bottom, leaving a clear, saturated solu-
tion. Bubbling carbon dioxide gas through this saturated solution
causes reactions that finally precipitate calcium carbonate, which is
roughly 10 times less soluble than calcium hydroxide. 
(a) The first reaction is the apparent “dissolving” of a tiny amount of

carbon dioxide in water. What we believe really occurs is that
some carbon dioxide gas reacts with water to form carbonic acid
in solution. Write a balanced chemical equation to represent this
reaction.

(b) The acid reacts with dissolved calcium hydroxide to form calcium
carbonate precipitate. Write a balanced chemical equation to rep-
resent this reaction.

(c) Use the reaction equations to explain why this is a test for the
presence of CO2(g).

(d) If the calcium hydroxide solution were not saturated, or nearly
so, would this diagnostic test still work? Explain the reasoning
behind your answer.

(e) Plot a solubility curve for Ca(OH)2, using the data in Table 2.
(f) Assuming you wished to prepare 1.0 L of saturated limewater

solution to be stored at a normal room temperature of 22°C, what
minimum mass of solid calcium hydroxide would you require?
Why should you actually use considerably more than the min-
imum required?

(g) Does the solubility curve of this compound fit the generalization
about the solubility of ionic solids at different temperatures?
Does this mean that the generalization is not valid or useful?
Discuss briefly.

Crystallization

Have you ever opened a jar of liquid honey only to find that the clear, golden
syrup is mixed with hard, white particles (Figure 3)? This is an example of what
happens to a saturated sugar solution (honey is mostly sugar and water) when
some of the water evaporates. The white particles are sugar crystals that have
come out of solution in a process called crystallization. This crystallization
process also occurs naturally (and extremely slowly) during the formation of sta-
lactites and stalagmites in caves (Figure 4).

Crystallization can be artificially speeded up by heating a solution to evapo-
rate off the solvent. With less solvent present, the concentration of the solute
quickly exceeds the solubility, so the excess solute crystallizes out. This evapora-
tion method is used industrially to isolate the solid solute from many solutions.
For example, table salt and table sugar are produced industrially by heating sat-
urated solutions of the substances. Rapid evaporation forms lots of small crys-
tals, which are then screened for uniformity of size. Crystals of unwanted sizes
are just redissolved and cycled through the process again. Large crystals can be
formed by slowly evaporating the solvent (Figure 5).

There are several experimental designs that we can use to determine the sol-
ubility (maximum concentration) of a solid. In Unit 2 you used precipitation
and filtration as an experimental design to determine the quantity of a solute
present in a solution. Later in this unit you will use a titration procedure to deter-
mine the concentration of a solution. At this point you are going to use a proce-
dure called crystallization. Crystallization involves removing the solvent from a
solution by evaporation, leaving behind the solid solute—which can then be col-
lected and measured.

Liquid honey normally crystallizes over time.
The label instructions usually suggest that
you just place the container in warm water
for a while if you want the sugar crystals to
redissolve.

A significant part of the work of science is to test existing theories, laws, and gen-
eralizations. Your purpose in this investigation is to test the solubility curve for an
ionic solid. To do this, you will create a graph from the solubility data (Table 4),
and use this graph to predict the solubility of sodium chloride in water at a par-
ticular temperature. You will then compare the predicted value with a value that
you determine experimentally—by crystallization of sodium chloride from a sat-
urated solution.

Question

What is the solubility of sodium chloride at room temperature?

Prediction

(a) Create a graph of the data in Table 4, and use it to predict the solubility of
sodium chloride in water at the measured room temperature. (You will be
able to improve the precision of your prediction if you start the vertical
axis at 35 g/100 mL instead of the usual zero value.)

Solubility Categories

People have been using the property of solubility for thousands, perhaps mil-
lions, of years. Over the last couple of hundred years, experimenters have been
investigating solubility in a more quantitative fashion, and have developed tables
of solubilities of various substances under a variety of conditions. Measurements
of extremely high precision show that all substances are soluble in water to some
extent—so the question then just becomes, to what extent? The solubilities of
various simple ionic compounds range from very high solubility, like that of
ammonium chloride, to extremely low solubility, like that of silver chloride.
Strictly speaking, nothing is absolutely insoluble in water, but we use the term
insoluble to mean negligible solubility—where the effect of the quantity that will
dissolve is not easily detectable. This means that, although your drinking glass
may dissolve to the extent of a few hundred molecules every time you wash it,
you won’t have to worry about the effect for a few million years.

As you probably found in Chapter 3, reading solubility tables takes a little
practice. You will notice that Table 5, page 324, shows only the anions as headings.
We can safely assume that most compounds containing those anions have similar
solubilities. It is useful to classify simple ionic compounds into categories of high
and low aqueous solubility. The classification allows you to predict the state of
many compounds formed in single and double displacement reactions. Of course,
any defined cutoff point between high and low solubility is entirely arbitrary. We
usually assign a solubility of 0.1 mol/L as the cutoff point, because most ionic
compounds have solubilities either significantly greater or significantly less than

Figure 6

the solute.

high solubility: with a maximum concen-
tration at SATP (standard ambient tempera-
ture and pressure) of greater than or equal to
0.1 mol/L

low solubility: with a maximum concen-
tration at SATP of less than 0.1 mol/L

insoluble: a substance that has a negli-
gible solubility at SATP



324 Chapter 7

this value. As well, we often work with solution concentrations of 0.01 mol/L to
1.0 mol/L in school laboratories. In other words, we choose this 0.1 mol/L cutoff
because it usually works for our purposes.

As with all simple generalizations that usually work, there are exceptions.
There are some compounds with solubilities that are low, but close enough to
our cutoff to cause problems in investigation. Calcium sulfate has a low solubility
by our definition (about 0.02 mol/L at SATP), and when a spoonful is stirred into
water it doesn’t appear to dissolve. However, a conductivity test shows that
enough does dissolve for the saturated solution to noticeably conduct electric
current (Figure 7). This also means that, if you washed a sample of CaSO4(s) in a
filter paper with water, you would be losing a little bit of your sample every time
you rinsed it, slowly ruining your experiment’s accuracy.

There is another familiar compound that is only slightly soluble in water:
calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH2(s)), used to make limewater, which is used in a
common diagnostic test for CO2(g). This compound is defined as having low sol-
ubility by our arbitrary cutoff point, but it is actually soluble enough to have a
noticeable effect. Bubbling carbon dioxide gas through this saturated solution
causes reactions that finally precipitate calcium carbonate, which has very low
solubility. A precipitate is a pure, solid substance that appears in a solution, either
as a result of a reaction or because of decreasing solubility.

One final example of a substance that is defined as having low solubility, but
that in fact does dissolve very slightly, is oxygen. The solubility of oxygen gas in

If we rely on visual evidence, calcium sulfate
appears insoluble, but other evidence (i.e.,
conductivity) indicates that the solubility is
very low but not negligible.

The Solvay Process—An Effect of Solubility

In Chapter 5 you studied the sequence of chemical reactions called the Solvay
process. This commercial process was developed to produce sodium carbonate,
Na2CO3(s), a compound historically called soda ash and now commonly known
as washing soda. The overall reaction for the Solvay process is

CaCO3(s) � 2 NaCl(aq) → Na2CO3(aq) � CaCl2(aq)

The key to the process, however, wasn’t really a chemical change. Ernest
Solvay used a solubility effect to separate chemicals in solution, and found a way
to produce the product at one-third of the previous cost. This made Solvay both
wealthy and famous, as you can imagine.



326 Chapter 7

The reactants in the crucial step of the overall process are NH4HCO3(aq) and
NaCl(aq). Using our solubility chart, we find this reaction improbable.

NH4HCO3(aq) � NaCl(aq) → NH4Cl(aq) � NaHCO3(s)

From the generalizations you have learned, all the possible products are
high solubility compounds, and should not precipitate in water solution.
According to our solubility table (Table 5), none of the possible ion combina-
tions has low solubility.

However, the solubility table gives solubilities at SATP. Solvay’s effect was
made possible by Solvay’s realization that, in cold water, the solubility of
NaHCO3 (7 g/100 mL at 0°C) is lower than the solubility of NH4HCO3 
(12 g/100 mL at 0°C). It is also much lower than the solubilities of either NH4Cl
or NaCl (Figure 2). This meant that the solution, at room temperature, would
already be nearly saturated with sodium hydrogen carbonate. When he decreased
the temperature, the Na+(aq) and HCO3

–
(aq) combination reached its solubility

limit and crystallized out of the solution as NaHCO3(s), leaving the other more
soluble ions behind.

7.2 Hard Water Treatment
When using soap in the bath, do you find that a floating scum forms on the sur-
face of the bath water? Is there a hard, greyish-white scale inside your kettle and
pipes (Figure 1)? When you wash your hands, does your soap fail to produce a
good lather? This is all evidence that you have hard water. When detergents were
initially developed they were hailed as a laundry revolution. They were chemicals
formulated to work even in hard water, without producing the precipitates
common when using soap.

When water travels through soil and rock it dissolves some of the minerals
from the rock. Some minerals will always dissolve in ground water: The amount
that dissolves depends on the rock type. Some rocks, such as granite, contain
mostly low-solubility minerals. Other rocks, such as limestone, contain large quan-
tities of minerals that dissolve relatively easily in water. The ground water that flows
through or over such rock will then contain metal cations, such as calcium, Ca2+(aq),
magnesium, Mg2+(aq), iron(II), Fe

2+
(aq), iron(III), Fe

3+
(aq), and manganese, Mn

2+
(aq).

Water hardness is primarily due to calcium and magnesium ions. The hard-
ness index used by chemists is the total concentration of these two ions,
expressed in milligrams per litre (which is equivalent to parts per million). There
is no agreed-upon standard system for grading water hardness, but Table 1 shows
an approximate classification.

Water Softening

Water is “softened” by removing the calcium and magnesium ions. This may be
done during large-scale water treatment, or within a home or business by various
kinds of commercial water-softening devices (Figure 2).

In some parts of Ontario the hardness of the water is a problem. As you
learned earlier in your study of freshwater treatment, municipalities in these
areas often use the soda-lime process to soften the water. Both sodium carbonate
(the soda) and calcium hydroxide (called hydrated lime or slaked lime) are added
to the hard water. After a series of reactions, the calcium and magnesium ions in
the hard water are precipitated out as the respective carbonates, softening the
water. This process depends entirely on differences in solubility, as both calcium
and magnesium carbonates are much less soluble than the respective hydrogen
carbonate (bicarbonate) compounds found in water.

Scale deposits caused by hard water can reduce the efficiency of some kitchen appliances.

Na2CO3(aq) + Ca(HCO3)2(aq) → CaCO3(s) + 2 NaHCO3(aq)

Home water softening usually uses an ion exchange process. In the soft-
ener tank is a bed of small resin (plastic) grains, through which the water is
passed. You can think of the molecules of resin as extremely long chains, along
which are attached many charged sulfonate groups: SO3

� (Figure 3). The resin
begins with sodium ions attached to each sulfonate group. When hard water
moves through the resin, calcium and magnesium ions attach to the sulfonate
groups, displacing the sodium ions into the water (Figure 3). Water emerging
from the resin is thus “softened”: Sodium ions have been exchanged for the
water’s calcium and magnesium ions.

Eventually, there will be no more sodium ions left on the resin. The water
softener must then be regenerated or the disposable cartridge replaced.
Regeneration involves washing the resin with a saturated brine (sodium chloride)
solution from a salt tank attached to the water softener. This causes sodium ions
to replace the calcium and magnesium ions on the resin. The hard water ions are
flushed down the drain, and the softener is ready to work for another cycle.

Home softeners may regenerate by clock setting, usually during the night. More
advanced models measure water usage, and regenerate only when the resin’s
capacity to exchange ions is nearly exhausted. This means that less salt is wasted, but
these models are more expensive. Water softened in this way becomes higher in
sodium ions, which may be a concern for people on low-sodium diets. Potassium
chloride is sometimes used in place of sodium chloride in the brine tank. Marketers
claim that since plants require potassium, this may be better for the environment, as
well as for people on low-sodium diets. Potassium ions do not work quite as well as
sodium ions, though, and KCl(s) is more expensive to buy than NaCl(s).

7.3 Reactions in Solution
At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned the removal of soap deposits in,
for example, a bathtub or shower enclosure. The deposits (precipitates) form
when soluble soap chemicals react with hard-water ions. The resulting calcium
stearate, being insoluble, precipitates out on the walls of the shower.

sodium stearate(aq) + calcium hydrogen carbonate(aq) →

calcium stearate(s) + sodium hydrogen carbonate(aq)

To remove these deposits, we could initiate a chemical reaction between the
calcium stearate and the cleaning agent to produce soluble products that would
rinse away.

calcium stearate(s) + cleaning agent(aq) → products(aq)

Your solubility table is useful in predicting solubilities, but there are many
more low- and high-solubility ionic compounds than are presented in the table.
From a scientific perspective, choosing the right chemical for the cleaning agent
is a matter of choosing the right cation and anion. In this section, we look at
chemical reactions that will either produce precipitates in the laboratory or
remove precipitates at home.

According to the collision theory, all chemical reactions must involve colli-
sions between atoms, ions, or molecules. If there are more collisions, there will be
more reactions. Imagine a reaction between a solid and a gas. Collisions can occur
only on the relatively small surface area of the solid. If the same quantity of solid
is broken up, it will have far more surface area, so more collisions will occur and
the substances will react more quickly. Chopping firewood into kindling to make
it easy to light is a simple example of this. Dissolving a solid in a solution is the
ultimate breaking-up of that solid, since the substance is reduced to the smallest
possible particles: separate atoms, ions, or molecules. This creates the largest pos-
sible surface area and, therefore, the greatest number of collisions. This situation
is only possible in gas- or liquid-phase solutions, but is very common.

The purpose of this investigation is to test the solubility generalizations con-
tained in a solubility table. To do this, you will use the solubility table (Table 5,
page 324, or Appendix C) to predict possible precipitates.

Make a Prediction, carry out the Procedure, then complete the Analysis and

Net Ionic Equations

Two students, performing Investigation 7.3.1, were curious about the yellow pre-
cipitate that formed when they mixed lead(II) nitrate with potassium iodide.
They looked in the solubility table, and predicted that the precipitate is lead(II)
iodide. They set out to design an experiment to provide evidence in support of
their prediction. They decided to mix aqueous lead(II) nitrate with aqueous
sodium iodide, and aqueous lead(II) acetate with aqueous magnesium iodide to
see if they got the same yellow precipitate as they observed for lead(II) nitrate
with potassium iodide.

The first student mixed aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and sodium iodide
and observed the instant formation of a bright yellow precipitate (Figure 1). The
student’s lab partner recorded the same observation after mixing aqueous solutions
of lead(II) acetate and magnesium iodide. The balanced chemical equations for
these reactions show some similarities and some differences.

(1) Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)

(2) Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 NaI(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq)

(3) Pb(C2H3O2)2(aq) + MgI2(aq) → PbI2(s) + Mg(C2H3O2)2(aq)

The evidence gathered from these reactions is identical: yellow precipitates.
This supports the students’ prediction that the yellow precipitate is lead(II)
iodide. The results of this test increase our confidence in both the double dis-
placement reaction generalization and the solubility generalizations.

Let’s now see if we can develop a theoretical description for reactions 1, 2,
and 3 above.

Using the Arrhenius theory of dissociation, we can describe these reactions
in more detail. We believe that each of the high-solubility ionic reactants disso-
ciates in aqueous solution to form separate cations and anions. For example,
reaction (1) could be written as follows:

Pb2+(aq) + 2 NO3
–
(aq) + 2 K

+
(aq) + 2 I

–
(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 K

+
(aq) + 2 NO3

–
(aq)

Notice that the precipitate, PbI2(s), is not dissociated because lead(II) iodide
has a low solubility. If an ionic compound does not dissolve, it cannot dissociate
into individual ions. The chemical equation above is called a total ionic equa-
tion. It shows what entities are present in the reaction. In this total ionic equa-
tion, the nitrate and potassium ions present on the reactant side also appear
unchanged among the products.

Chemical reaction equations normally do not show chemical substances that
do not change in any way. We can extend this practice to entities in solution—in
this case, the ions that do not change. Any ion (or other entity, such as molecules
or atoms) present in a reaction system that does not change during the course of

pounds in their dissociated form

the chemical reaction is called a spectator. A spectator ion is like a spectator at a
hockey game—present for the action but not taking part in the game. By
ignoring these ions and rewriting this reaction equation showing only the enti-
ties that change, you write a net ionic equation for the reaction. When modifying
a total ionic equation to give a net ionic equation, be careful to cancel only iden-
tical amounts of identical entities appearing on both reactant and product sides.

(1) Pb2+(aq) + 2 NO

+

�

can be shortened to

Pb2+(aq) + 2 I
–
(aq) → PbI2(s) (net ionic equation) 

Similarly, for reaction (2),

(2) Pb2+(aq) + 2 NO
�
3(aq)� + 2 Na

+
(aq)� + 2 I

–
(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 Na

+
(aq)� + 2 NO

�
3(aq)�

becomes

Pb2+(aq) + 2 I
–
(aq) → PbI2(s) (net ionic equation)

If we apply the same procedure to reaction (3),

(3) Pb2+(aq) + 2 C2H3O2
–
(aq) + Mg

2+
(aq)� + 2 I

–
(aq) → PbI2(s) + Mg

2+
(aq)� + 2 C2H3O2

–
(aq)

is written

Pb2+(aq) + 2 I
–
(aq) → PbI2(s) (net ionic equation)

Notice that the same observation made from three apparently different
chemical reactions gives the same net ionic equation. Although solutions of dif-
ferent substances were combined in these two cases, the net ionic equation makes
it clear that the same chemical reaction occurs. Apparently, bright yellow lead(II)
iodide will precipitate when we mix any two solutions containing both lead(II)
ions and iodide ions.

Writing Net Ionic Equations

1. Write the balanced chemical equation with full chemical formulas for all
reactants and products.

2. Using solubility information, such as the table in Appendix C, rewrite the
formulas for all high-solubility ionic compounds as dissociated ions, to
show the total ionic equation.

3. Cancel identical amounts of identical entities appearing on both reactant
and product sides.

4. Write the net ionic equation, reducing coefficients if necessary.

7.4 Waste Water Treatment
In Chapter 6 we looked at the treatment of drinking water, and the ways in which
we make sure that it is safe. Then, earlier in this chapter we explored the tech-
nologies used to reduce the effects of hard water. In this section we will look at
another aspect of water treatment: the treatment of waste water (Figure 1).

Ideally, all used water returned to the environment would be clean enough
to be drinkable, whatever kind of treatment was necessary. In reality, though,
some municipalities still permit raw sewage to be discharged into our rivers,
lakes, and coastal waters.

Sewage is anything that gets flushed out of our homes through the sewer
pipes, and includes a considerable amount of organic waste. There are three
major problems with organic waste.

First is the issue of disease transmission. Untreated sewage may contain
bodily wastes from people with a wide range of infectious diseases, many of
which can be transmitted by contact with feces. If the disease-causing organisms
are not killed, they could easily cause infection in anyone who drinks, swims in,
or washes with the contaminated water.

The second problem is that the decomposition (rotting) of organic wastes
uses up a lot of oxygen. Biologists measure the use of dissolved oxygen by bac-
teria, and call it the BOD—the biological oxygen demand. This is defined as the
quantity of oxygen used up by bacteria over five days at 20°C to decompose any
organic matter that is present in (or added to) water. A high BOD reading indi-
cates that there is a lot of organic matter in the water, and that a considerable
quantity of oxygen is being removed from the water in order to decompose those
organics. Oxygen is really only very slightly soluble in water. Under natural con-
ditions, oxygen is present in water to about a 0.010 g/L (10 ppm) level at a tem-
perature of 10°C, and about 8 ppm at 25°C. Many fish and other aquatic
organisms require a minimum of about 4–5 ppm of oxygen to survive. Bacteria,
growing as a result of raw sewage discharge into a river, can therefore cause a crit-
ical lowering in oxygen levels for a long way downstream. This effect is even more
serious if the river flows slowly and so the water is not naturally aerated. The low
oxygen level can be a serious problem for anything living in the water.

2. In a water treatment plant, sodium phosphate is added to remove
calcium ions from the water. Write the net ionic equation for the
reaction of aqueous calcium chloride and aqueous sodium phos-
phate.

silver nitrate solution by reacting it with copper metal. Write the

The third problem is that the decomposition of organic matter releases
chemicals, including nitrates and phosphates, that stimulate the rapid growth of
aquatic plants and algae. As the surface plants grow in much greater abundance
than is usual, they block out light to deeper water, killing the bottom-dwelling
plants. Later, as the artificially fertilized “bloom” dies away, it becomes another
load of organic material to be decomposed—and to use up dissolved oxygen.

Along with organic waste, many other materials are delivered into the
sewers: cleaning solutions (e.g., phosphates), paint (e.g., oil-based paints),
garden chemicals (e.g., fertilizers and pesticides), insoluble materials (e.g., cal-
cium and magnesium carbonates), minerals from water softeners (e.g., sodium
and chloride ions), and so on. All of these would be harmful if discharged

2. Secondary treatment is a two-step process. The first step
usually involves aerating the water to support oxygen-using
organisms, which react with dissolved organic substances
to produce a sludge precipitate. The second step is chlorination,
which further purifies the water. The resulting sludge may be
used as landfill or fertilizer, although any heavy metal pollutants
present are not removed. About 90% of BOD is removed from the
water by the end of this stage. After this treatment, the water
could be returned to the environment as it is suitable for most
non-drinking purposes.

3. Tertiary treatment, if used, may involve
a wide variety of systems and processes
resulting in water clean enough for
drinking. These processes may include
reverse osmosis, steam distillation,
chemical precipitation—anything that will
remove virtually all remaining organic
chemicals and any harmful dissolved ionic
compounds. This stage is the most
expensive.

directly into the natural environment. Fortunately, provided that they are only
present in small quantities, the waste water treatment system can deal with them.

Treatment of waste water is becoming more and more important as urban
populations grow, and high-quality drinking water becomes more scarce. The
general sequence for treatment of municipal sewage is shown in Figure 2.

In Canada there is public pressure to place the responsibility for waste water
treatment on the user. The idea is that waste water should be cleaned and treated
to a point that is not polluting. Not only is the treatment beneficial to life forms
in the river, but also to anyone downstream who wants to use that river’s water
as a municipal supply of drinking water.

There are many parts of Ontario where homes and businesses are not con-
nected to municipal sewage treatment facilities. In most cases, this is not a
problem. The sewage is either stored in a holding tank until it is periodically
pumped out and trucked away, or it is piped directly into a septic system (Figure 3).
Here the solid matter is decomposed by bacteria, and the liquid is piped off to a
leaching bed, where it gradually trickles through layers of sand and gravel and
eventually runs down into the water table. Although septic systems generally
remove most of the organic material and bacteria from the sewage, they cannot
remove the other substances, such as phosphates (from cleaning products) and
nonaqueous liquids.

The natural environment can tolerate a certain amount of pollution. For
example, the combination of sunlight with a healthy community of organisms
living in large bodies of fresh water is able to break down some of the pollutants
from domestic sewage, agricultural fertilizers, and industrial waste. Small quan-
tities of these chemicals—nitrates, phosphates, and organic compounds—can be
broken down by chemical reactions or by natural bacteria into simple, non-pol-
luting substances such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen.

7.5 Qualitative Chemical Analysis
Chemical analysis of an unknown chemical sample can include both

• qualitative analysis—the identification of the specific substances present,

and
• quantitative analysis—the measurement of the quantity of a substance

present.

You have probably heard about at least one widely used chemical analysis:
the blood test for alcohol. Technicians test a blood sample to determine whether
ethanol (from alcoholic beverages) is present, and if so, how much is present. As
another example, water quality analysts are continually checking our drinking
water for a wide variety of dissolved substances, some potentially harmful, some
beneficial.

You have already seen many examples of qualitative analysis, such as the
colour reaction of litmus paper to identify the presence of an acid or a base. The
conductivity test for electrolytes, the limewater test for carbon dioxide, the explo-
sion (“pop”) test for hydrogen gas, and the glowing splint test for oxygen are all
qualitative analyses. As you can see, qualitative analysis is often used for diag-
nostic testing. We can plan diagnostic tests using the format, “If [procedure], and
[evidence], then [analysis].” For example, if cobalt(II) chloride paper is exposed
to a liquid or vapour [procedure], and the paper turns from blue to pink [evi-
dence], then water is likely present [analysis].

Flame tests, such as those that you may have conducted in Investigation
1.4.2, are also qualitative analyses.

Qualitative Analysis by Colour

You have already learned in Unit 1 that some ions have a characteristic colour in
a solution, a flame, or a gas discharge tube.

First, let’s look at the colours of aqueous solutions. Most aqueous solutions
are colourless, as Table 1 shows: ions of elements in Group 1, 2, and 17 have no
colour at all. Other ions, not listed in the table, are also colourless. However,
many solutions containing monatomic and polyatomic ions of the transition ele-
ments do have a colour in solution.

Sample Problem 1

According to the evidence in Table 2 and Figure 1, which of the numbered solu-
tions is potassium dichromate, sodium chloride, sodium chromate, potassium
permanganate, nickel(II) nitrate, and copper(II) sulfate? (Refer to Table 1.)

Solution

According to Table 2 and Table 1, the solutions are (1) potassium permanganate,
(2) sodium chloride, (3) nickel(II) nitrate, (4) sodium chromate, (5) copper(II)
sulfate, and (6) potassium dichromate.

matter that has no numerical value expressed

342 Chapter 7

You may be familiar with the blue colour of solutions containing copper(II)
ions, such as copper(II) sulfate, but did you know that copper(II) ions produce a
green flame (Figure 2)?

We can use flame tests to indicate the presence of several metal ions, such as
copper(II), calcium, and sodium (Table 3). In a flame test, a clean platinum or
nichrome wire is dipped into a test solution and then held in a nearly colourless
flame (Figure 2). The wire is cleaned by dipping it alternately into hydrochloric
acid and then into the flame, until very little flame colour is produced. There are
other ways to conduct flame tests: you could dip a wood splint in the aqueous
solution and then hold it close to a flame; you could hold a tiny solid sample of
a substance in the flame; or you could spray the aqueous solution into the flame.

Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff took the idea of the
flame test and developed it into a technique called spectroscopy (Figure 3).
Bunsen had previously invented an efficient gas laboratory burner that produced
an easily adjustible, hot, nearly colourless flame. Bunsen’s burner made better
research possible—a classic example of technology leading science—and made
his name famous. Bunsen and Kirchhoff soon discovered two new elements,
cesium and rubidium, by examining the spectra produced by passing the light
from flame tests through a prism.

Flame tests are still used for identification today. Of course, the technology
has become much more sophisticated. The equipment used is called a spec-
trophotometer (Figure 4). It analyzes the light produced by samples vaporized in
a flame. It can even detect light not visible to humans. The spectrophotometer
can detect minute quantities of substances, in concentrations as tiny as parts per
billion. By measuring the quantity of light emitted, this device can also do quan-
titative analysis—measuring the concentrations of various elements precisely
and accurately. Forensic scientists may use this technique of high-tech qualitative
analysis when gathering evidence for criminal investigations. Similar technology
is used in a completely different branch of science: astronomy. Astronomers
study the light spectra from distant stars to find out what elements the stars are
composed of.

Sequential Qualitative Chemical Analysis

In addition to colours of solutions and flames, analytical chemists have created
very specific qualitative tests for ions in aqueous solution. These specific tests use
the precipitation of low-solubility products. The chemist plans a double dis-
placement reaction involving one unknown solution and one known solution,
and predicts that, if a precipitate forms, then a certain ion must have been
present in the unknown solution. Solubility tables help the chemist (and us) to
choose reactants that will produce precipitates as evidence of the presence of spe-
cific ions. This type of test is called a qualitative chemical analysis.

Suppose you were given a solution that might contain either lead(II) ions or
strontium ions, or possibly both or neither. How could you determine which
ions, if any, were present? You could perform a qualitative analysis. For this, you
must design an experiment that involves two diagnostic tests, one for each ion—
that is, tests that definitely identify a particular substance. Of course, it is hard to
identify an ion in a solution unless it forms a compound with low solubility. In
other words, unless it forms a precipitate. So you choose reactants that, if lead(II)
ions or strontium ions were present, would form a precipitate.

Test for the Presence of Lead(II) Ions

Let’s test for the possible presence of lead(II) ions in a solution, before going on
to test for the presence of strontium ions (Figure 5, page 344). Chloride ions
form a low-solubility compound with lead(II) ions, so if lead(II) ions are present

in a solution, a precipitate forms when chloride ions are added. An appropriate
source of chloride ions would be a solution of sodium chloride—a high-solubility
chloride compound. Refer to the solubility table (Appendix C) to confirm that
strontium ions do not precipitate with chloride ions, but that lead(II) ions do.

If sodium chloride solution is added to a sample of the test solution and a
precipitate forms, then lead(II) ions are likely present and the following reaction
has taken place.

Pb2+(aq) + 2 Cl
�
(aq) → PbCl2(s)

We add an excess of sodium chloride so that there are sufficient chloride ions
to precipitate all of the lead(II) ions, leaving none in solution. This makes certain
that there are no leftover lead(II) ions to interfere with a subsequent test for
strontium ions.

When a sample under investigation (e.g., our unknown solution) is combined
with an excess quantity of another reactant (e.g., sodium chloride), all of the sample
reacts. The reactant that is completely used up (in this case, lead(II) ions) is called
the limiting reagent. The reactant that is present in more than the required quan-
tity (the chloride ions) is called the excess reagent.

Our precipitate indicates that lead(II) ions were present in the solution. Now
we need to test our solution for strontium ions. First, however, we should remove
the lead(II) chloride precipitate by filtering the solution. The remaining filtrate
can then be tested for strontium ions.

Test for the Presence of Strontium Ions

What strontium-containing compound would form a precipitate? A look at the
solubility table shows us that a compound containing sulfate ions and strontium
ions is relatively insoluble. If a highly soluble sulfate solution (e.g., sodium sul-
fate) is added to the filtrate, and a precipitate forms, then strontium ions are
likely to be present. (In the unlikely event that there are still some lead(II) ions
in solution, they will react with the sulfate ions and would precipitate also.) If
Sr2+(aq) is present, then

Sr2+(aq) + SO4
2–
(aq) → SrSO4(s)

If we see a precipitate form, it is likely to be strontium sulfate. This indicates
the presence of strontium ions in the original solution. We could also confirm
the presence of strontium ions with a flame test.

In our example, both the unknown solution and the diagnostic-test solu-
tions contained dissociated ions. If a precipitate forms, collisions must have
occurred between two kinds of ions to form a low-solubility solid. The chloride
and sodium ions present in the diagnostic-test solutions are spectator ions.

By carefully planning an experimental design for qualitative chemical
analysis, you can do a sequence of diagnostic tests to detect many different ions,
beginning with only one sample of the unknown solution.

We can use our experimental design as a guide for planning diagnostic tests
for many ions (Figure 6, page 346).

To complete a sequential analysis involving solubility, follow these steps. (These
steps are written for cation (metal ion) analysis. For anion analysis, reverse the
words cations and anions.)

Recognize that the absence of a precipitate is an indicator that the ion being
tested for is not present. Realize that sometimes an experimental design can be
created where parallel tests rather than sequential steps are used. For example,
you can test for the presence or absence of calcium and mercury(I) ions by
adding sulfate and chloride ions to separate samples of a solution.

A security guard noticed a trickle of clear liquid dripping from a drainage
channel in the warehouse of a chemical plant. The guard alerted the chemists. To
find out which of the containers of chemical solutions was leaking, the chemists
needed to find out what ions were in the leaked solution. They decided to test for
the most likely ions first.

348 Chapter 7

Quantitative analysis quite often follows qualitative analysis. Many of us can
detect the presence of alcohol by its odour. This is a crude (but direct) form of
qualitative analysis. If the police suspect someone of drinking and driving, they
may decide to use a breathalyzer. Breathalyzers can indirectly determine the level
of blood alcohol quantitatively. Exhaled air (which may contain alcohol) is blown
through a bright orange solution containing dichromate ions. If there is alcohol
in the breath, it reacts with the dichromate ions to produce chromium(III) ions.
The new solution is pale green in colour. This change in colour is detected when
light of a certain wavelength is shone through the solution. The light that passes
through is converted into an electric current by a photocell. The size of the elec-
tric current is indicated on a current meter, which is labelled in terms of blood
alcohol content.

There is a more direct (and therefore more certain) way of measuring blood
alcohol content. This method involves taking a blood sample and reacting it for
several hours with the same kind of solution as in the breathalyzer. A laboratory
technologist then performs a procedure called titration to determine the con-
centration of alcohol in the blood. The legal limit for blood alcohol varies from
0 to 0.080 g/100 mL (800 ppm), depending on what kind of driving licence the
suspect holds. If the suspect’s blood alcohol concentration is greater than the
legal limit, the police may decide to press impaired driving charges.

There are various experimental designs used to determine blood alcohol
content. Most of the current designs require chemical reactions and stoichiom-
etry for quantitative analysis. In this section you will learn how to complete stoi-
chiometric calculations involving reactions in solution.

Solution Stoichiometry

In Unit 2 you saw the usefulness of gravimetric (mass-to-mass) stoichiometry for
both prediction and analysis. However, most reactions in research and industry
take place in aqueous solutions. This is because chemicals in solution are easy to
manipulate, and reaction rates and extents in solution are relatively easy to con-
trol—not to mention the fact that many chemical reactions only occur if the
reagents are in solution. We therefore need to learn how to find the concentra-
tion of reactants in solutions. Scientists have developed a concept to help them
do this, a concept known as solution stoichiometry.

When using the concept of solution stoichiometry, we often know some of
the information, such as the mass or concentration of one of the products of a
reaction. We can then use this information to determine another quantity, such
as the molar concentration of a reactant.

Stoichiometry Calculations

When performing any kind of stoichiometry calculation by any method, follow
these general steps.

1. Write a balanced equation for the reaction, to obtain the mole ratios.

2. Convert the given value to an amount in moles using the appropriate con-
version factor.

3. Convert the given amount in moles to the required amount in moles, using
the mole ratio from the balanced equation.

4. Convert the required amount in moles to the required value using the
appropriate conversion factor.

It is more financially viable to recycle metals if they are in fairly concentrated
solutions, so recycling companies will pay more for those solutions than for more
dilute solutions. How do companies find out how much silver, for example, is in
a solution? Technicians carry out a reaction that involves removing all the silver
from a known volume of the solution, drying it, and measuring its mass.
Knowing the mass of silver and the volume of solution, they can calculate the
molar concentration of silver in the solution.

The purpose of this investigation is to use the stoichiometric concept to find
the unknown concentration of a known volume of aqueous silver nitrate: to
extend gravimetric stoichiometry into solution stoichiometry.

Although you will not be conducting this investigation, the investigation
report models the type of report that you will be expected to produce in later
investigations. Here the evidence is provided. You are to complete the Analysis
section.

Question

What is the molar concentration of silver nitrate in the aqueous solution pro-
vided?

Experimental Design

A precisely measured volume of aqueous silver nitrate solution, AgNO3(aq), is
completely reacted with excess copper metal, Cu(s). The silver metal product,
Ag(s), is separated by filtration and dried, and the mass of silver measured to the
precision of the balance. The concentration of the initial solution is calculated
from the mass of product by the stoichiometric method.

of the copper from Day 1 has reacted away, proceed to step 5.

5. Add another coil of copper wire, cover with a watch glass, and set aside
until the next day.

6. When the reaction is complete, remove the wire coil, using shaking,
washing, and rubbing with a stirring rod to make sure that all solid silver
particles remain in the beaker.

7. Measure and record the mass of a piece of filter paper.

8. Filter the beaker contents to separate the solid silver from the filtrate.

9. Do the final three washes of the solid silver and filter paper with acetone
from a wash bottle. Catch the rinsing acetone in a waste beaker.

10. Place the unfolded filter paper and contents on a paper towel to dry for a
few minutes.

11. Measure and record the mass of the dry silver plus filter paper.

12. Dispose of the remaining substances by placing solids in the garbage (or
recycling them), and rinsing aqueous solutions (not acetone) down the
drain with plenty of water. Transfer the acetone to a recycle container.

Evidence

The following observations were recorded:
volume of silver nitrate solution = 100.0 mL
mass of filter paper = 0.93 g
mass of filter paper plus silver = 2.73 g
The copper wire in the silver nitrate solution turned black, grey, and then silver,

with spikes of silvery crystals growing from the copper wire.
The solution gradually went from colourless to blue.
There was an excess of copper wire at the end of the reaction time.
After cleaning and washing, the copper wire was noticeably thinner.

Using Molar Concentration

In Lab Exercise 7.6.1 you calculated the molar concentration of silver nitrate
from the mass of silver, the molar mass of silver, and the volume of the solution.
This was a stoichiometric calculation.

Some solution stoichiometry problems are a little more complicated.
Sometimes a problem may involve determining the amount (in moles) of a sub-
stance by considering how much of that substance reacts with, or is produced by,
a known quantity of another substance. In other words, solving the problem is
dependent upon writing a balanced chemical equation for the reaction, and con-
verting from concentration (or volume) to amount in moles, and back again.

When you did gravimetric stoichiometry calculations in Chapter 5, you used
molar mass as the conversion factor to convert from mass to amount in moles,
and back to mass. In solution (volumetric) stoichiometry you use molar con-
centration as a conversion factor.

However, the general stoichiometric method remains the same. Whatever
value you initially measure, you have to first convert it to an amount in moles by
using a conversion factor. Second, use the mole ratio between the chemicals with
given and required values. Finally, use an appropriate conversion factor to convert
the required amount in moles into the requested value with appropriate units.

Let us now work through a typical stoichiometry calculation involving
molar concentrations of aqueous solutions.

Many popular chemical fertilizers include ammonium hydrogen phosphate
(Figure 3). This compound is made commercially by reacting concentrated
aqueous solutions of ammonia and phosphoric acid. The reaction is most effi-
cient if the right proportions of reactants are used. Of course, the amounts
required will depend on the concentrations of the reactant solutions. What
volume of 14.8 mol/L NH3(aq) would be needed to react completely with each
1.00 kL (1.00 m3) of 12.9 mol/L H3PO4(aq) to produce fertilizer in a commercial
operation?

Step 1: Write a balanced chemical equation to find the relationship between the
amount of ammonia (in moles) and the amount of phosphoric acid (in
moles).

Beneath the equation, list both the given and the required measurements,
and the conversion factors, in that order.

Step 4: Convert the amount of ammonia to the quantity requested in the ques-
tion; in this example, volume. To obtain the volume of ammonia, the
molar concentration (which is the amount/volume ratio) is used to con-
vert the amount in moles to the solution volume. Note that the prefix
“kilo” does not cancel, while the unit “mol” does.

The following sample problem shows how to solve and communicate a solu-

Sample Problem 1

Chemical technologists work in the laboratories of chemical industries. One of
their jobs is to monitor the concentrations of solutions in the process stream. For
example, sulfuric acid is a reactant in the production of sulfates (e.g., ammonium
sulfate) in fertilizer plants. A technician needs to determine the concentration of
the sulfuric acid solution. In the experiment, a 10.00-mL sample of sulfuric acid
reacts completely with 15.9 mL of 0.150 mol/L potassium hydroxide solution.
Calculate the molar concentration of the sulfuric acid.

Understanding Concepts 

1. Ammonium sulfate is a “high-nitrogen” fertilizer. It is manufactured
by reacting sulfuric acid with ammonia. In a laboratory study of this
process, 50.0 mL of sulfuric acid reacts with 24.4 mL of a 2.20 mol/L
ammonia solution to yield the product ammonium sulfate in solution.
From this evidence, calculate the molar concentration of the sulfuric
acid at this stage in the process.

2. Slaked lime is sometimes used in water treatment plants to clarify
water for residential use. The lime is added to an aluminum sulfate
solution in the water. Fine particles in the water stick to the floc pre-
cipitate produced, and settle out with it. Calculate the volume of
0.0250 mol/L calcium hydroxide solution that can be completely
reacted with 25.0 mL of 0.125 mol/L aluminum sulfate solution.

3. In designing a solution stoichiometry experiment for her class to per-

ness of a reaction. Carefully run a drop or

the beaker and watch for any additional pre-

the limiting reagent remains in the filtrate

Barium sulfate is a white, odourless, tasteless powder that has a variety of dif-

paints, and inks; and taken internally for gastrointestinal X-ray analysis. It is so
insoluble that it is non-toxic, and is therefore very safe to handle.

Acids and Bases
Acid indigestion, commercial antacid remedies for indigestion, pH-balanced
shampoos—you don’t have to look far in a drugstore to find labels referring to
acids or acidity. Many people think that all acids are corrosive, and therefore dan-
gerous, because solutions of acids react with many substances. Yet boric acid is
used as an eyewash. Can this be as dangerous as it sounds?

References in the popular media offer no insight into what acids and bases
are, or what they do. In fact, such references usually emphasize only one per-
spective, such as the environmental damage caused by an acid or the cleaning
power of a base. As a result, popular ideas are often confusing. An amateur gar-
dener who has just read an article describing the destruction of conifer forests by
acid rain may be puzzled by instructions on a package of evergreen fertilizer
stating that evergreens are acid-loving plants (Figure 1).

This chapter takes a historical approach, presenting evidence and following
the development of theories about the substances we call acids and bases. These
theories are used to explain and predict the behaviour of acids and bases.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• experimentally determine the
empirical properties, including
pH, of acids and bases;

• design and conduct an experi-
ment to determine the effect of
dilution on pH;

• explain acids and bases, using
both Arrhenius and Brønsted-
Lowry theories;

• describe and explain the differ-
ence between strong and weak
acids and bases;

• use the terms: ionization, dissoci-
ation, strong acid/base, weak
acid/base, hydronium ion, proton
transfer, conjugate acid/base,
titration, titrant, and endpoint;

• write balanced chemical equa-
tions for reactions involving acids
and bases;

• develop the skills involved in titra-
tion and solve stoichiometry
problems using titration evidence;

• describe examples of solutions
for which the concentration must
be known and exact.

362 Chapter 8

8.1 Understanding Acids and Bases
The story of acids and bases is progressive: It is unfolding like a detective story.
Our understanding of acids and bases has changed over time as we have extended
our concepts to include more and more acids and bases. Early scientists
described acids, for example, as compounds that produce hydrogen gas when
reacted with an active metal. These scientists realized that acids (at least, some
acids) contain hydrogen atoms. To other investigators, acids were substances that
contain oxygen and that react with limestone to produce carbon dioxide.

Later, investigators discovered that acids in aqueous solution change blue
litmus to red and conduct electricity. These observations did not fit with the ear-
lier definitions of acids. A new explanation was needed.

Acids and bases share some properties with molecular and ionic substances,
and have some properties that are unique.

Table 1 shows that pure liquid samples of both ionic compounds and bases
conduct electricity. Similarly, aqueous solutions of both ionic compounds and
bases conduct electricity. In some way, bases seem to be similar to ionic com-
pounds. What is it about ionic compounds that enables them to conduct elec-
tricity? According to Arrhenius, ionic compounds separate into ions when they
are liquid or in solution. Can we assume that the same is true of bases? Perhaps
they, too, separate into ions. The presence of mobile ions would explain the con-
ductivity.

Do all bases release the same ion in aqueous solution? Many bases are ionic
compounds that contain a hydroxide, OH�, which could be released in solution.
It seems likely that this ion gives a base its characteristics. After all, sodium chlo-
ride, NaCl, is not a base but sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is. Going by the evidence
we have at this stage, we can conclude that bases are ionic hydroxides that release
mobile hydroxide ions in solution.

NaOH(s) → Na
+
(aq) + OH

�
(aq)

Ca(OH)2(s) → Ca
2+
(aq) + 2 OH

�
(aq)

Table 1 also shows that molecular substances, including acids, do not con-
duct electricity in their pure states. However, acids (unlike other molecular sub-
stances) become conductors when dissolved in water. Arrhenius explained that
molecular substances do not conduct electricity because they contain only elec-
trically neutral particles called molecules. Can we conclude, therefore, that acids
in their pure forms contain neutral molecules and not ions, but that acids in
solution contain ions? This is certainly what the evidence suggests. It seems that
acids are somehow different in structure and/or composition from other molec-
ular substances.

Table 1: Properties of Pure and Aqueous Substances

Conductivity Litmus

Substance Solid Liquid Aqueous Aqueous

most molecular compounds no no no no effect

most ionic compounds no yes yes no effect

acids no no yes blue to red

bases no yes yes red to blue

Liquid Ionic Compounds

How hot does an ionic compound have to be,
before we can test it for conductivity?
Because of the strong ionic bonds, it has to
be heated to extremely high temperatures
(700 –1000°C). When the ionic bonds are
broken, the ions are free to move around and
the substance can conduct electricity.

DID YOU KNOW ?



Acids and Bases 363

8.1

By studying the composition of substances that turn blue litmus red in an
aqueous solution, scientists found that acids seem to contain hydrogen atoms.
This led scientists to write the chemical formula for acids as HA(aq) (Table 2).
The electrical conductivity of these acidic solutions led to the theory that acids
ionize in water to release hydrogen ions, H+(aq). Acids, then, according to the evi-
dence, are hydrogen-containing compounds that ionize in water to produce
hydrogen ions.

HCl(g) → H
+
(aq) + Cl

–
(aq)

HNO3(aq) → H
+
(aq) + NO

–
3(aq)

Arrhenius extended his theory of ions to explain some of the properties of
acids and bases. According to Arrhenius, we can write an equation showing that
bases dissociate into individual positive and negative ions in solution. He pro-
posed that aqueous hydroxide ions were responsible for the properties of basic
solutions, such as turning red litmus paper blue. The dissociation of bases is sim-
ilar to that of any other ionic compound, as shown in the following dissociation
equation for barium hydroxide.

Ba(OH)2(s) → Ba
2+
(aq) + 2 OH

–
(aq)

According to the evidence in Table 1, acids are electrolytes in solution even
though as pure substances, they are molecular compounds. Acids, such as HCl(g)
and H2SO4(l), do not show their acidic properties until they dissolve in water.
Since acids in solution are electrolytes, Arrhenius’ theory suggests that acid solu-
tions must contain ions. However, the pure solute is molecular; it is made up only
of neutral molecules. How, then, can its solution contain ions? Obviously, acids
do not simply dissolve to form a solution of molecules. According to Arrhenius,
after acids dissolve as individual molecules, they then ionize into hydrogen ions
and negative ions in solution.

In the case of acids, Arrhenius assumed that the water somehow causes the
acid molecules to ionize, but he didn’t propose an explanation for this. (We now
believe that water molecules help to pull the molecules apart—to ionize the
acid.) A typical example of an acid is hydrogen chloride gas dissolving in water to
form hydrochloric acid. We can describe this process with an ionization equation.

HCl(g) → H
�
(aq) + Cl

�
(aq)

So, although HCl is a molecular compound, it appears to behave in solution
as if it were ionic. It ionizes into ions, which are capable of conducting electricity
in solution. We explain the properties of acids by saying that all acids produce
hydrogen ions in solution, and define acids as substances that ionize in water to
increase the hydrogen ion concentration.

Formulas of Acids 

The 19th century idea was that acids are
salts (compounds) of hydrogen. For example,
scientists would say that HCl(aq) is the
hydrogen salt of NaCl(aq). This led to the
practice of writing hydrogen first in the 
formulas of substances known to form acidic
solutions, such as H2SO4(aq) and HCl(aq).

364 Chapter 8

The Arrhenius theory was a major advance in understanding chemical sub-
stances and solutions. Arrhenius also provided the first comprehensive theory of
acids and bases. The empirical and theoretical definitions of acids and bases are
summarized in Table 3.

Sample Problem 1

Write dissociation or ionization equations (as appropriate) for the dissolving of
the following chemicals in water. Label each equation as either dissociation or
ionization.

(a) potassium chloride (a salt substitute)

(b) hydroiodic acid (a strong acid)

Solution

(a) KCl(s) → K+(aq) + Cl
�
(aq)(dissociation)

(b)  HI(aq) → H

(aq) + I

�
(aq) (ionization)

As Sample Problem 1 shows, ionic substances dissociate in water, but acids
ionize.

Acids as pure substances are molecular and, as such, may be solids, liquids,
or gases at SATP (standard ambient temperature and pressure). When you are
writing ionization equations for acids, you may not always know the initial state
of matter. If you do know the state, use (s), (l), or (g) subscripts; if you do not
know the pure state of the acid, use (aq). This is correct for now, as all the acids
you will be using in this course are in aqueous solution. For example,

HCl(g) or HCl(aq) → H

(aq) + Cl

Strong and Weak Acids

Different acidic solutions have different electrical conductivity. We can see this
from laboratory evidence (Figure 1). There seem to be two fairly distinctive
classes of acids. If we were to test the electrical conductivity of a variety of acids
at equal concentration and temperature, we might collect evidence such as that
in Table 4. If we were then to analyze the evidence, we could classify the acids
according to the acid strength, as is shown in the last column.

We can classify all acids as either strong or weak. Acids whose solutions have
high electrical conductivity are called strong acids. Their high electrical conduc-
tivity is explained by their high percentage ionization. Most (more than 99%) of
the acid molecules ionize. Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid are
examples of strong acids. (These strong acids are among those identified in the
table of Concentrated Reagents in Appendix C, page 636.) Most other common
acids, such as carbonic acid, are weak acids. Their low conductivity is explained
by their very low percentage ionization.

Figure 1

In solutions of equal concentration,
hydrochloric acid is a very good conductor of
electricity; acetic acid conducts electricity
less well.

nitrous acid HNO2(aq) low weak

carbonic acid H2CO3(aq) low weak

hydrochloric acid HCl(aq) high strong

sulfuric acid H2SO4(aq) high strong

nitric acid HNO3(aq) high strong
strong acid: (theoretical definition) an
acid that ionizes almost completely (>99%) in
water to form aqueous hydrogen ions

percentage ionization: the percentage
of molecules that form ions in solution

weak acid: (empirical definition) an acid
with characteristic properties less than those
of a strong acid; (theoretical definition) an
acid that ionizes only partially (<50%) in
water to form aqueous hydrogen ions, so
exists primarily in the form of molecules



366 Chapter 8

You have probably heard that some acids are dangerous. How do you know
which ones to treat with particular caution? For safety purposes you need to pay
more attention to the strength of the acid than the concentration. A dilute solu-
tion of a strong acid can be more dangerous than a concentrated solution of a
weak acid. This is because the corrosive property of acids is due to the hydrogen
ion. The more hydrogen ions in solution, the more dangerous the solution. As a
general rule, show respect for all acids, but especially strong acids.

To communicate the percentage ionization and the strength of an acid under-
going ionization, we can write the percentage ionization over the chemical equation
arrow. Strong acids generally ionize >99%, while weak acids generally ionize <50%.

HNO3(aq)
>99%
→ H+(aq) + NO3

�
(aq) (a strong acid)

HC2H3O2(aq)
<50%
→ H+(aq) + C2H3O2

�

Sample Problem 2

The following acidic solutions were tested (at equal concentration and tempera-
ture) for electrical conductivity. Write ionization equations to explain the relative
conductivity of each acid.

(a) hydrobromic acid (aqueous hydrogen bromide): high conductivity

(b) hydrofluoric acid (aqueous hydrogen fluoride): low conductivity

Acids and Bases

At this point, the only strong acids that you have to know about are hydrochloric
acid, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid. You can assume that all other acids are weak,
unless you are told otherwise.

You can also assume that all bases are ionic hydroxides, all of which are
strong bases.

8.2 pH of a Solution
Skin care and hair care products are often advertised as being pH balanced. What
does this mean? It sounds like a good thing, but what is pH, and how can it be
balanced? 

pH is a way of indicating the concentration of hydrogen ions present in a
solution. You have just discovered that all acids release H+ ions when they ionize
in water. And you know that we can define concentration as the amount of a sub-
stance (in moles) present in a given volume of a solution. Chemists have com-
bined these concepts into a way of communicating the acidity of a solution: a
concise code for the concentration of H+(aq) ions. This code is the pH scale.

The molar concentration of hydrogen ions is extremely important in chem-
istry. According to Arrhenius’s theory, hydrogen ions are responsible for the
properties of acids, and the higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, the more
acidic a solution will be. Similarly, the higher the concentration of hydroxide
ions, the more basic a solution will be. You might not expect a neutral solution
or pure water to contain any hydrogen or hydroxide ions at all. However, careful
testing yields evidence that even pure water always contains tiny amounts of both
hydrogen and hydroxide ions, due to a slight ionization of the water molecules
(Figure 1). In a sample of pure water, about two of every billion water molecules
ionize to form hydrogen and hydroxide ions.

H2O(l) → H
�
(aq) + OH

�
(aq)

This gives a hydrogen ion concentration of about 1 × 10–7 mol/L. Most con-
ductivity tests will show no conductivity for pure water (unless the equipment is
extremely sensitive). The concentration of hydrogen ions declines when a base is
dissolved in the water. The hydroxide ions released by the base react with the
hydrogen ions freed by the ionization of water to produce water molecules. The
result is a decline in the concentration of hydrogen ions.

8.2

Aqueous solutions show a phenomenally wide range of hydrogen ion con-
centrations—from more than 10 mol/L for a concentrated hydrochloric acid
solution, to less than 1 × 10–15 mol/L for a concentrated sodium hydroxide solu-
tion. Any aqueous solution can be classified as acidic, neutral, or basic using a
scale based on the hydrogen ion concentration. Note that the square brackets
around the H+(aq) ion indicate “molar concentration.”

• In a neutral solution, [H�(aq)] = 1 × 10
–7 mol/L.

• In an acidic solution, [H�(aq)] > 1 × 10
–7 mol/L.

• In a basic solution, [H�(aq)] < 1 × 10
–7 mol/L.

The extremely wide range of hydrogen ion concentrations led to a conven-
ient shorthand method of communicating these concentrations. This method,
called pH, was invented in 1909 by Danish chemist Søren Sørenson. The pH of a
solution is defined as the negative of the exponent to the base 10 of the hydrogen
ion concentration (expressed as moles per litre). This is not quite as complicated
as it sounds. For example, a solution with a hydrogen concentration of 10–7 mol/L
has a pH of 7 (neutral). Similarly, a pH of 2 corresponds to a much higher
hydrogen ion concentration of 10–2 mol/L (acidic).

We can rearrange this relationship to show that pH is the negative of the
power of 10 of the hydrogen ion molar concentration.

[H+(aq)] = 10
–pH

This relationship can be used, without complicated mathematics, to convert
between pH and the hydrogen ion concentration. For example, if the hydrogen
ion concentration is 1 × 10–5 mol/L, then the pH is 5.0. If the pH is 8.0, then the
hydrogen ion concentration is 1 × 10–8 mol/L.

Notice, in Table 1, that the certainty (as expressed in the number of signifi-
cant digits) of the hydrogen ion concentration provides the precision (as
expressed in the number of decimal places) of the pH. The number of decimal
places for the pH is equal to the number of significant digits in the hydrogen ion
concentration. This is because the integer of the pH (e.g., 7) does not count as a
significant digit any more than the exponent in 10–7 (i.e., 7) does.

Figure 1

Pure distilled water has a very slight elec-
trical conductivity that is only noticeable
when tested with a very sensitive meter.

The “p” in pH

pH was developed only about 100 years ago,
but already the origin of the term has become
blurred. Some scientists associate pH with
power of hydrogen H; others with potential
of hydrogen. Sørenson was Danish, so per-
haps the “p” in pH comes from the Danish
word “potenz,” meaning “strength,” or the
French word “potentiel.” It is strange that we
have so quickly lost the origin of such a
familiar term.

pH is specified on the labels of consumer products such as shampoos, in
water-quality tests for pools and aquariums, in environmental studies of acid
rain, and in laboratory investigations of acids and bases. Since each pH unit cor-
responds to a factor of 10 in the concentration, a huge [H�(aq)] range can now be
communicated by a simple set of positive numbers (Figure 2). In these applica-
tions, dilution is often an important consideration. What happens to the pH
when a solution is diluted? When the pH changes by one unit (e.g., from 5 to 6),
the hydrogen ion concentration has been decreased by a factor of ten (i.e., from 
10–5 mol/L to 10–6 mol/L). When the hydrogen ion concentration changes by a
factor of 100 (e.g., from 10–2 mol/L to 10–4 mol/L), the pH changes by 2 units
(i.e., from 2 to 4).

Another way of changing the pH is by a neutralization reaction, in which
hydrogen ions react with hydroxide ions to move the pH closer to 7. Removing
hydrogen ions from the solution is a more effective method of changing the pH
than diluting the solution. For this reason, spills of acids and bases are more often
neutralized than diluted. Diluting the solution helps to make the solution less
hazardous, but neutralizing the solution is more effective.

Measuring pH of a Solution

You may have already measured the pH of solutions using pH indicators or pH
paper (Figure 3) to estimate the approximate value. In some situations, such as
testing garden soil or aquarium water, this is appropriate. However, in scientific
analysis we usually require more precise measurement. For example, when envi-
ronmental scientists and technicians study the effects of acid rain in waterways,
small pH changes in a large body of water can be significant. Precise pH meas-
urements are normally made using a pH meter. All pH meters operate like small
electric cells in which the electricity produced by the cell depends on the acidity
of the solution. With modern electronics, the tiny electrical signals are detected,
converted, and displayed on a screen or dial as the pH. Some pH meters, partic-
ularly older ones, are small desktop units (Figure 4); some newer meters can be
just as precise, yet are as small as a pencil.

Even more recent pH meters consist of a pH probe connected to a computer.
The main advantage of this technology is that the pH can be sampled, recorded,
and even graphed continuously and automatically. However, if you are just going
to take a few pH readings, a system without a computer is perfectly adequate.

pH paper has a range of possible colours.

372 Chapter 8

For many years it has been common practice for some municipalities, industries,
businesses, and consumers to dispose of hazardous wastes in lakes and rivers
(Figure 5). This is often justified by an argument based on the dilution of the
wastes by a relatively large volume of water. Some critics refer to this argument
as “the solution to pollution is dilution.” There are many reasons why this rea-
soning is not valid. One reason is the environmental effect of bioamplification,
in which initially minute quantities of contaminants are concentrated to dan-
gerous quantities higher up the food chain (Figure 6). But there may also be
other effects that are not immediately obvious. The purpose of this investigation
is to study the effect of dilution on the pH of a solution and develop a general-
ization for any trends observed.

In previous work (see Section 6.5), you practised preparing a solution by a
careful dilution of a starting solution. You can use the same skills and equipment

What effect does the dilution of an acidic solution have on the pH of the solution?

Experimental Design

paper. A sample of this solution is precisely diluted and the pH (dependent vari-
able) is measured. This process is repeated several times to obtain measures of
pH for a range of concentrations (independent variable). The temperature of the
solution is a controlled variable.

Calculating pH and Hydrogen Ion Concentration

Earlier in this section you saw that a hydrogen ion concentration can be
expressed as a simple pH. The relationship between [H�(aq)] and pH is easy to cal-
culate if the concentration is only a power of ten, such as 10–3 mol/L where the
pH = 3, or [H+(aq)] = 1 × 10

–7 mol/L where the pH is 7.0. This is clearly illustrated
in Figure 2, page 370. What if the concentration of hydrogen ions is not so

simple, such as 2.7 × 10�3 mol/L? To answer this question you need to know that,
in mathematics, the logarithm of a number is the exponent when the number is
written in exponential form. For example, ignoring certainty in significant digits,

100 = 102 log10(10
2) = 2

0.001 = 10�3 log10(10
�3) = �3

In general, if y = 10x, then log10(y) = x. Fortunately, all scientific calculators
have a function key, labelled “log,” that will find the logarithm (exponent) for any
number in the display of the calculator (Figure 7). Because hydrogen ion con-
centrations are usually less than 1 mol/L, pH is defined as the negative logarithm
to avoid having almost all pHs as negative numbers. This is simply a convenience
agreed to by all scientists—a convention of communication. On your calculator
and in general usage, log is normally understood to mean log10. Therefore, the
mathematical definition of pH becomes,

pH = –log[H+(aq)]

Values of pH can be calculated from the hydrogen ion concentration, as shown
in the following example. The digits preceding the decimal point in a pH value are
determined by the digits in the exponent of the hydrogen ion concentration. These
digits locate the position of the decimal point in the concentration value and do
not indicate the certainty of the value. However, the number of digits following the
decimal point in the pH value is equal to the number of significant digits expressing
the certainty of the hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a hydrogen ion con-
centration of 2.7 × 10–3 mol/L (note the two significant digits) corresponds to a pH
of 2.57 (note the two decimal places). The 2.7 in the 2.7 × 10–3 mol/L value indi-
cates the certainty as two significant digits. The 3 in the 2.7 × 10–3 mol/L value only
indicates where the decimal point goes. The .57 in the pH value of 2.57 communi-
cates a certainty of two significant digits. The 2 in the 2.57 pH value does not count
as measured digits; it only indicates where the decimal place in the value goes, i.e.,
the power of 10 of the value. The examples below will help to clarify this for you.

Sample Problem 3

An antacid solution has a hydrogen ion concentration of 4.7 × 10–11 mol/L. What
is its pH? (See Figure 8.)

Solution

pH = –log[H�(aq)]

= –log(4.7 × 10–11)

(Note that the certainty of both values is expressed as two significant digits.)

If pH is measured in an acid–base analysis, you may have to convert a pH
reading to the molar concentration of hydrogen ions. This conversion is based on
the mathematical concept that a base ten logarithm represents an exponent.
Therefore, the pH becomes the exponent.

8.3 Working with Solutions
Everyone deals with solutions on a daily basis. Tap water, soft drinks, air, gaso-
line, and alloys such as the “gold” used in jewellery are just a few common exam-
ples of homogeneous mixtures called solutions. Many foods contain acidic
solutions. Cleaning solutions often contain bases. Sometimes we prepare solu-
tions, for example, when we dissolve flavour crystals and sugar in water to make
an inexpensive drink, or make a cup of tea, or dilute a concentrated cleaner in
water. In most cases we pay some attention to concentration, although it may be
measured only roughly, and adjust it to our requirements.

Some people regularly handle solutions as a part of their work. The kinds of
solutions vary tremendously, depending on the occupation. However, the prepa-
ration and use of solutions is generally more technologically advanced and pre-
cise than we would encounter at home (Figure 1).

Career Solutions
The training requirements for careers that involve solutions vary from high
school chemistry for a job as a tree-planter to a Ph.D. degree in chemistry
for a career in pure research chemistry.

Environmental Chemist

Environmental chemists often specialize in particular aspects of the air, water, or soil. Many
of them use solutions  as either reactants or samples in chemical analysis. The concentra-
tions of these samples are usually critically important. This career requires a higher degree of
chemistry training than technicians and teachers. To be an environmental researcher requires
considerable perseverance and optimism as well as an ability to ask questions and design
experiments. Some of the research involves understanding the components and processes in
the environment and some research may focus on the nature and effects of pollution.

Chemistry Teacher

A chemistry or physical science teacher must have a knowledge of solutions,
and be able to handle them safely. In this course and many of your previous
science courses, you will have seen and used solutions on many occasions.
At most schools, the teachers prepare the solutions that you use, plan the
reactions that you do, and sometimes need to be very resourceful in
cleaning some stains from glassware by reacting the stain with other chemi-
cals such as acids and bases. Chemistry and other physical science teachers
need a good understanding of solutions in order to prepare for lab activities.
These teachers are in great demand in schools and universities.

Water-Quality Analyst

A water-quality analyst or technician in a water treatment
plant works with aqueous solutions every day. Physical and
chemical tests are routinely done to determine the treat-
ment of the raw water and to monitor the quality of the
final treated water. Many chemical tests (such as the
analysis of dissolved iron ions, calcium ions, and chlorine)
require the preparation of other reagent (reactant) solutions
to conduct the tests. Both solution preparation and reac-
tions in solution are important parts of the job of a water-
quality analyst.

8.4 Acid–Base Theories
Acids and bases can be distinguished by means of a variety of properties (Table 1).
Some properties of acids and bases are more useful than others to a  chemist, espe-
cially those that can be used as diagnostic tests, such as the litmus test.

Many acids and bases are sold under common or traditional names. As you
have learned, concentrated hydrochloric acid is sometimes sold as muriatic acid.
Sodium hydroxide, called lye as a pure solid, has a variety of brand names when
sold as a concentrated solution for cleaning plugged drains. Generic or “no-
name” products often contain the same kind and quantity of active ingredients
as brand name products. You can save time, trouble, and money by knowing that,
in most cases, the chemical names of compounds used in home products must
be given on the label. If you discover that your favourite brand of scale remover
is an acetic acid solution, you may be able to substitute vinegar to do the same
job less expensively, assuming that the concentrations are similar.

Strong and Weak Acids

Are all acids similar in their reactivity and their pH? Do acidic solutions at the
same concentration and temperature possess acidic properties to the same
degree? Not surprisingly, the answer to this question is that each acid is unique.
The pH of an acid may be only slightly less than 7, or it may be as low as –1. We
discussed in Section 8.1 that solutions of strong acids have a much greater con-
ductivity than those of weak acids and the difference can be explained by per-
centage ionization. As you might suspect, the percentage ionization has an effect
on the pH of acid solutions.

We can explain the differences in properties between strong and weak acids
using the Arrhenius theory and percentage ionization. For example, hydrogen
chloride is a strong acid because it is believed to ionize completely (more than
99%) in water. The high concentration of H+(aq) ions gives the solution strong
acid properties and a low pH.

HCl(aq)
>99%
→ H�(aq) + Cl

�
(aq)

This means that for each mole of hydrogen chloride dissolved, about one
mole of hydrogen ions is produced.

There are relatively few strong acids: Hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acids
are the most common.

*Note that for reasons of safety it is not appropriate to use taste or touch as diagnostic tests in 
the laboratory.



Acids and Bases 379

A weak acid is an acid that ionizes partially in water. Measurements of pH
indicate that most weak acids ionize less than 50%. Acetic acid, a common weak
acid, is only 1.3% ionized in solution at 25°C and 0.10 mol/L concentration. The
relatively low concentration of H+(aq) ions gives the solution weaker acid proper-
ties and a pH closer to 7.

HC2H3O2(aq) 
1.3%
→ H�(aq) + C2H3O2

�
(aq

For each mole of acetic acid dissolved, only 0.013 mol of H+(aq) ions is produced.
When we observe chemical reactions involving acids we can see that some

acids (such as acetic acid), although they react in the same manner and amount
as other acids (such as hydrochloric acid), do not react as quickly. This is why
weak acids are generally so much safer to handle, and even to eat or drink, than
strong acids. Most of the acids you are likely to encounter are classed as weak
acids (Figure 1).

The concepts of strong and weak acids were developed to describe, explain,
and predict these differences in properties of acids.

The Arrhenius Concept of Acids and Bases

In 1887 Svante Arrhenius created a theory of ions to explain the electrical con-
ductivity of solutions. Arrhenius explained that ionic compounds form solu-
tions that conduct electricity because these compounds dissociate as they
dissolve to release an anion and a cation. For example, potassium hydrogen sul-
fate forms an electrically conductive solution because it dissolves as two ions.

KHSO4(s) → K
�
(aq) or HSO4

�
(aq)

Scientists had previously agreed that acids were hydrogen compounds.
Arrhenius added to this theory by suggesting that acids are hydrogen compounds
that ionize to increase the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution. For
example, hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water and ionizes almost completely
to increase the hydrogen ion concentration.

HCl(g) → H
�
(aq) + Cl

�
(aq)

Arrhenius was also able to explain in a theoretical way why bases have their
characteristic properties. He suggested that bases are ionic hydroxides that dis-
solve in water to increase the hydroxide ion concentration of the solution. For
example, potassium hydroxide dissociates in water to increase the hydroxide ion
concentration.

KOH(s) → K
�
(aq) + OH

The Arrhenius Theoretical Definitions

The purpose of this investigation is to test the Arrhenius definitions of acids and
bases. As part of this investigation, you are asked to make a Prediction. Do not
base your Prediction on experience or a personal hypothesis—use only the
Arrhenius theoretical definitions. Assume that the Arrhenius concept restricts
dissociation and ionization: Bases dissociate to produce OH�(aq) and a cation; and
acids ionize to produce H�(aq) and an anion.

substances in solution (see Materials) as acidic, basic, or neutral. (Refer to

Revision of Arrhenius’ Definitions

Arrhenius’ definitions cannot always predict whether a substance is an acid or a
base. Using Arrhenius’ definitions, you would probably correctly predict that
HCl(aq) and HC2H3O2(aq) are acids; that NaOH(aq) and Ca(OH)2(aq) are bases;

Hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide are irri-
tants. Wear eye protection

Acids and Bases 383

and that NaNO3(aq) is neutral. However, by Arrhenius’s definitions, we would
predict all of the following compounds to be neutral, but they are not:

• compounds of hydrogen polyatomic ions (NaHCO3(aq) and NaHSO4(aq))
• oxides of metals and nonmetals (CaO(aq) and CO2(g))
• compounds that are neither oxides nor hydroxides (e.g., NH3(aq) and

Na2CO3(aq)), but yet are bases
• compounds that contain no hydrogen (e.g., Al(NO3)3(aq)), but yet are acids

Clearly, the Arrhenius theoretical definitions of acid and base need to be
revised or replaced.

A theoretical concept has two
major purposes: to explain current evi-
dence and to predict the results of new
experiments. While the first purpose is
useful, it is not valued as much as the
ability to predict results. Theoretical
progress is made when theories not
only explain what is known but also
allow valid predictions to be made
about new situations.

We need to revise Arrhenius’
acid–base definitions to explain the
exceptions listed above. The new
theory involves two key ideas: colli-
sions with water molecules and the
nature of the hydrogen ion. Since all
substances tested are in aqueous solu-
tion, then particles will constantly be
colliding with, and may also react with,
the water molecules present.

It is highly unlikely that the particle we call an aqueous hydrogen ion, H
+
(aq),

actually exists in an acidic solution. If such a particle were to come near polar
water molecules, it would bond strongly to one or more of the molecules (Figure 2),
that is, it would be hydrated. There is no evidence for the existence of unhydrated
hydrogen ions in aqueous solution. However, the Canadian scientist Paul
Giguère has done experiments that provide clear evidence for the existence of
hydrated protons (Figure 3). The simplest representation of a hydrated proton is
H3O

+
(aq), commonly called the hydronium ion (Figure 4).
We can now explain the formation of acidic solutions by strong acids such

as HCl(aq) as a reaction with water, forming hydronium ions (Figure 5).

HCl(g) + H2O(1)
>99%

A strong acid, such as HCl, is considered to react completely with water. In
other words, the collisions with water molecules are very successful, producing a
100% reaction. What about weak acids? Because they have lesser acidic properties,

When gaseous hydrogen chloride dissolves in

384 Chapter 8

there must be fewer hydronium ions produced from the same volume and con-
centration of solution compared with strong acids. Therefore, the collisions of
weak acid molecules with water cannot be very successful. Based on pH meas-
urements, 0.10 mol/L acetic acid, a common weak acid, is only successful in
forming hydronium ions in 1.3% of its collisions with water molecules.

In general, acidic solutions form when substances react with water to form
hydronium ions.

The concept of acids reacting with water to produce hydronium ions is a
small adjustment in thinking when explaining or predicting the behaviour of
typical acids. In most contexts, we can think of acids as either ionizing to pro-
duce hydrogen ions or reacting with water to produce hydronium ions.

Strong and Weak Bases

Evidence indicates that there are both strong bases (e.g., sodium hydroxide) and
weak bases (e.g., ammonia). For equal concentrations of solutions, strong bases
have high electrical conductivity and very high pH (>>7), whereas weak bases have
low electrical conductivity and pH closer to 7. We can explain the behaviour of
strong bases: They dissociate to increase the hydroxide ion concentration in an
aqueous solution. Further evidence indicates that all ionic hydroxides are strong
bases: 100% of the dissolved ionic hydroxides dissociates to release hydroxide ions.

What about weak bases? How can we explain their properties? The pure
compounds (e.g., NH3(g)) do not contain hydroxide ions, so they cannot disso-
ciate to release hydroxide ions. Nevertheless, solutions of weak bases appear to
contain hydroxide ions in a higher concentration than does pure water. Where do
they come from? Clearly, this question cannot be answered by the Arrhenius def-
inition of bases. We need to revise his theory to include a new concept: that weak
base molecules or ions react with water to produce hydroxide ions. This remains
consistent with the explanation for strong bases and for strong and weak acids.
Weak bases do not react 100% with water. Evidence indicates that they commonly
react less than 10%. This means that they produce fewer hydroxide ions than a
similar amount of a strong base, which accounts for the weaker basic properties
of weak bases.

Recall from Section 8.1 that ionic hydroxides produce basic solutions by
simple dissociation. We know that ionic hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide,
are strong bases.

Ba(OH)2(s) → Ba
2+
(aq) + 2 OH

–
(aq) (a strong base)

Here, there is no need to consider a reaction with water because we know
that ionic hydroxides, such as Ba(OH)2, dissociate to produce hydroxide ions.
However, there are many common examples of bases that are not ionic hydrox-
ides, such as ammonia (window cleaner) and sodium carbonate (washing soda).
Most bases, other than soluble ionic hydroxides, are weak bases. Weak bases may
be either ionic or molecular compounds in their pure state.

Ammonia and sodium carbonate each form basic aqueous solutions as
demonstrated by a litmus paper test. This equation for ammonia shows the
theory to explain the evidence:

NH3(aq) + H2O(l)
<50%
→ OH–(aq) + NH4

+
(aq) (a weak base)

pH

How does this new theory about acids affect
our concept of pH? Fortunately, the mathemat-
ical definition of pH works equally well with
hydronium ions as it did with hydrogen ions.

DID YOU KNOW ?

strong base: (according to the Arrhenius
theory and the “reaction-with-water” theory)
an ionic hydroxide that dissociates 100% in
water to produce hydroxide ions

weak base: (according to the “reaction-
with-water” theory) a chemical that reacts
less than 50% with water to produce
hydroxide ions



Acids and Bases 385

The presence of hydroxide ions explains the basic solution, and the less than
100% reaction explains the weak base properties. (Note that both atoms and
charge are conserved in the balanced equation.)

Sodium carbonate is an ionic compound with high solubility. According to
the Arrhenius theory, sodium carbonate dissociates in water to produce aqueous
ions of sodium and carbonate.

Na2CO3(s) → 2 Na
+
(aq) + CO3

2�
(aq)

The sodium ion cannot be responsible for the basic properties of the solu-
tion, because many sodium compounds (e.g., NaCl(aq)) form neutral solutions.
The basic character of carbonate solutions can be explained as resulting from
their reaction with water.

CO3

(aq) + H2O(l)

<50%
→ OH–(aq) + HCO3

–
(aq)

Note again that hydroxide ions explain the basic properties and that atoms
and charge are conserved in the balanced equation.

We now have explanations for the production of hydroxide ions by bases:
Strong bases (commonly ionic hydroxides) dissociate to produce hydroxide ions;
and weak bases react with water to increase the hydroxide ion concentration.
This theory is sometimes called the revised Arrhenius theory.

it had a pH greater than 7. Explain this evidence using chemical equations.

Solution

CN–(aq) + H2O(l)

The cyanide ion produces hydroxide ions in reaction with water, so is a weak
base. As a weak base, we expect the reaction to be less than 50% and the solution
to have a pH greater than 7 but not, say, greater than 13.

The Brønsted–Lowry Concept

Acid and base definitions, revised to include the ideas of the hydronium ion and
reaction with water, are more effective in describing, explaining, and predicting
the behaviour of acids and bases than are Arrhenius’ original definitions.
However, chemical research has shown that even these revised definitions are still
too restrictive. Reactions of acids and bases do not always involve water. Also, evi-
dence indicates that some entities that form basic solutions (such as HCO3

�
(aq))

can actually neutralize the solution of a stronger base. A broader concept is
needed to describe, explain, and predict these properties of acids and bases.

New theories in science usually result from looking at the evidence in a way
that has not occurred to other observers. A new approach to acids and bases was
developed in 1923 by Johannes Brønsted (1879–1947) of Denmark (Figure 6)
and independently by Thomas Lowry (1874–1936) of England. These scientists
focused on the role of an acid and a base in a reaction rather than on the acidic
or basic properties of their aqueous solutions. An acid, such as aqueous hydrogen
chloride, functions in a way opposite to a base, such as aqueous ammonia.
According to the Brønsted-Lowry concept, hydrogen chloride donates a proton
(H�) to a water molecule,

H+

HCl(aq) + H2O(1) → H3O
+
(aq) + Cl

–
(aq)

and ammonia accepts a proton from a water molecule.

Water does not have to be one of the reactants. For example, the hydronium
ions present in a hydrochloric acid solution can react directly with dissolved
ammonia molecules.

Acids and Bases 387

We can describe this reaction as NH3 molecules removing protons from
H3O

� ions. Hydronium ions act as the acid, and ammonia molecules act as the
base. Water is present as the solvent, but not as a primary reactant. In fact, water
does not even have to be present, as evidenced by the reaction of hydrogen chlo-
ride and ammonia gases (Figure 7).

H+

HCl(g) + NH3(g) → NH4Cl(s)
acid base

A substance can be classified as a Brønsted-Lowry acid or base only for a spe-
cific reaction. It is not a general property of a substance. This point is impor-
tant—a substance may gain protons in one reaction, but lose them in another
reaction with another substance. (For example, in the reaction of HCl with water
shown above, water acts as the Brønsted-Lowry base; whereas, in the reaction of
NH3 with water, water acts as the Brønsted-Lowry acid.) A substance that
appears to act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid in some reactions and as a Brønsted-
Lowry base in other reactions is called amphiprotic. The hydrogen carbonate ion
(HCO �3(aq)) in baking soda (Figure 8) is amphiprotic, like every other hydrogen
polyatomic ion. Hydrogen polyatomic ions, as their name suggests, are poly-
atomic ions containing hydrogen. Examples of amphiprotic substances include
HCO �3(aq), H2O(l), HSO

�
3(aq), H2PO

�
4(aq), and HPO4

2�
(aq).

Note that amphiprotic entities can either gain or lose a proton, as shown by
the following reactions. First let’s see what happens when the bicarbonate ion is
added to the solution of a strong acid, which will contain hydronium ions.

H+

HCO3
�
(aq) + H3O

�
(aq) → H2CO3(aq) + H2O(l) (neutralizes a strong acid)

Now let’s look at the reaction of the bicarbonate ion with the solution of a
strong base, which will contain hydroxide ions.

H+

HCO3

(aq) + OH

(aq) → CO3

2 –
(aq) + H2O(l) (neutralizes a strong base)

acid base

In both cases, the bicarbonate ion moves the pH of the solutions toward 7.
According to the Brønsted-Lowry concept, acid–base reactions involve the

transfer of a proton. Therefore, the products formed in these reactions must
differ from the reactants by a proton (H�). If you look again at the equations
above, you can see that this is true.

As another example, when acetic acid reacts with water, an acidic solution
(containing hydronium ions) is formed.

388 Chapter 8

The acetate ion product is simply what is left after an acetic acid molecule
loses its proton. The hydronium ion product is what is formed as a result of a
water molecule gaining a proton. Any proton that is lost can, in principle, be
regained and any proton that is gained can be lost in some other reaction.
Therefore, we can consider the acetate ion to be a potential Brønsted-Lowry base:
It could act as a base in another reaction. A product formed as a result of an acid
losing a proton is called a conjugate base. Similarly, the hydronium ion is a
potential Brønsted-Lowry acid: It could act as an acid in another reaction. A
product resulting from a base gaining a proton is called a conjugate acid.

Changing Ideas on Acids and Bases

Usually chemists discover the empirical properties of substances long before a
theory is developed to describe, explain, and predict their behaviour. For
example, several of the distinguishing properties of acids and bases were known
by the middle of the 17th century. Additional properties, such as pH and the
nature of acid–base reactions, were discovered by the early 20th century.

Let’s take an overview of the developing theory of acids and bases. It is a
story that took place over several hundred years, thanks to the innovative
thoughts and painstaking laboratory investigations of many great scientists.

Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) (Figure 9) assumed that oxygen was respon-
sible for acid properties and that acids were combinations of oxides and water.
For example, sulfuric acid, H2SO4, was described as hydrated sulfur trioxide,
SO3•H2O. There were immediate problems with this theory because some oxide
solutions, such as CaO, are basic, and several acids, such as HCl, are not formed
from oxides. This evidence led to the rejection of the oxygen theory, although we
still use the generalization that nonmetallic oxides (e.g., SO3) form acidic solu-
tions.

Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) (Figure 10) advanced a theory that the
presence of hydrogen gave a compound acidic properties. Justus von Liebig
(1803–1873) (Figure 11) later expanded this theory to include the idea that acids
are salts (compounds) of hydrogen. This meant that acids could be thought of as
ionic compounds in which hydrogen had replaced the metal ion. However, this
theory did not explain why many compounds containing hydrogen have neutral
properties (e.g., CH4) or basic properties (e.g., NH3).

Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) (Figure 12) developed a theory in 1887 that
provided the first useful theoretical definition of acids and bases. He described
acids as substances that ionize in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions, and
bases as substances that dissociate to form hydroxide ions in solution. This
theory explained the process of neutralization by assuming that H+(aq) and OH

–
(aq)

ions combine to form H2O(l). The various strengths of acids were explained in
terms of the degree (percentage) of ionization, but Arrhenius’s theory is limited
to aqueous solutions and cannot explain the properties of many common sub-
stances.

390 Chapter 8

Paul Giguère of the Université Laval, Quebec, found evidence that, in a solu-
tion, hydrogen ions are bonded to water molecules. The simplest representation
of an aqueous hydrogen ion is H3O

+
(aq), commonly known as a hydronium ion.

The concept of the hydronium ion was used to revise the Arrhenius definitions
of acids and bases. Now acids could be described as substances that react with
water to form hydronium ions, and bases could be described as substances that
dissociate or react with water to form hydroxide ions. This revised Arrhenius
theory is still limited to aqueous solutions but it does provide an explanation for
the properties of aqueous solutions of nonmetal oxides, metal oxides, and poly-
atomic anions.

Johannes Brønsted (1879–1947) of Denmark and Thomas Lowry
(1874–1936) of England independently developed a theory that focused on the
role of acids and bases in a reaction rather than on the properties of their
aqueous solutions. They defined acids as substances that donate protons (H+)
and bases as substances that accept protons in a chemical reaction. In the
Brønsted-Lowry concept, a substance can only be defined as an acid or a base for
a specific reaction. Ions such as hydrogen carbonate, HCO –3(aq), or hydrogen sul-
fite, HSO –3(aq), can act as acids in one reaction and as bases in another.

Changes in Knowledge

History indicates that it is unwise to assume that any scientific concept is the final
word. Whenever scientists assume that they understand a subject, two things
usually happen. Conceptual knowledge tends to remain static for a while,
because little falsifying evidence exists or because any falsifying evidence is
ignored. Then, when enough falsifying evidence accumulates, a revolution in
thinking occurs within the scientific community in which the current concept is
drastically revised or entirely replaced. The experience of the Swedish chemist
Svante Arrhenius gives some insight into the difficulty scientists have in getting
new ideas accepted.

While Arrhenius was attending the University of Uppsala near his home, he
became intrigued by the question of why some aqueous solutions conduct elec-
tricity, but others do not. This problem had puzzled chemists ever since Sir
Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday experimented over half a century earlier by
passing electric currents through chemical substances.

Faraday believed that an electric current produces particles of electricity,
which he called ions, in some solutions. He could not explain what ions were, or
why they did not form in aqueous sugar or alcohol solutions.

As a university student, Arrhenius noticed that conducting solutions differed
from non-conducting solutions in terms of another important property. The
freezing point of any aqueous solution is lower than the freezing point of pure
water; the more solute that is dissolved in the water, the more the freezing point
is lowered (depressed). Arrhenius found that the freezing point depression of
electrolytes in solution was always two or three times lower than that of non-
electrolytes, in solutions of the same concentration. He concluded that when a
solution such as pure table salt, NaCl, dissolves, it does not separate into NaCl
molecules in solution but rather into two types of particles. Since the NaCl solu-
tion also conducts electricity, he reasoned that the particles must be electrically
charged. In Arrhenius’ view, the conductivity and freezing point evidence indi-
cated that pure substances that form electrolytes are composed of charged ions,
not neutral atoms. The stage was now set for a scientific controversy. Faraday was
an established, respected scientist and his explanation agreed with Dalton’s

Prove Me Wrong!

In science, no theory can be proven. Well-
established, accepted theories have a sub-
stantial quantity of supporting evidence. On
the other hand, a theory can be disproven by
a single, significant, reproducible observa-
tion. In Einstein’s words: “No amount of
experimentation can ever prove me right; a
single experiment can prove me wrong.”

model of indivisible, neutral atoms. Arrhenius was an unknown university stu-
dent and his theory contradicted Dalton’s widely accepted model.

Despite strong supporting evidence, Arrhenius’s creative idea was rejected by
most of the scientific community, including his teachers. When Arrhenius pre-
sented his theory and its supporting evidence as part of his doctoral thesis, the
examiners questioned him for four gruelling hours. They grudgingly passed him,
but with the lowest possible mark.

For over a decade, only a few people supported Arrhenius’ theory. Gradually,
more supporting evidence accumulated, including J.J. Thomson’s discovery of
the electron in 1897. Soon, Arrhenius’s theory of ions became widely accepted as
the simplest and most logical explanation of the nature of electroytes. In 1903
Arrhenius won the Nobel Prize for the same thesis that had nearly failed him in
his PhD examination years earlier.

Arrhenius’ struggle to have his ideas accepted is not so unusual. Ideally, sci-
entists are completely open-minded, but they are people, and many people resist
change. We are sometimes reluctant to accept new ideas that conflict radically
with familiar ones.

Scientific Concepts

“Creating a new theory is not like destroying
an old barn and erecting a skyscraper in its
place. It is rather like climbing a mountain,
gaining new and wider views, discovering
unexpected connections between our starting
point and its rich environment. But the point
from which we started out still exists and can
be seen, although it appears smaller and
forms a tiny part of our broad view gained by
the mastery of the obstacles on our adven-
turous way up.”

8.5 Acid–Base Reactions
Acids take part in several characteristic reactions, including their reaction with
bases. This means that we can sometimes get clues about an unknown substance
by observing how it reacts, and what the products of the reaction are. For
example, imagine an emergency response team arriving at the site of a traffic
accident involving a chemical spill (Figure 1). At first team members are not sure
what the spilled chemical is, but then they notice that it seems to be reacting with
the magnesium/aluminum wheels of a car. They know that all acids react with
active metals (e.g., Mg(s), Zn(s), and Al(s)) to produce hydrogen gas, so it is likely
that the spilled chemical is an acid. They could confirm their suspicions with a
strip of litmus paper or by doing a quick test of a sample of the gas being pro-
duced. The acid/metal reaction is a single displacement reaction in which the
hydrogen in the acid behaves like a metal.

active metal + acid → H2(g) + ionic compound

For example:

Mg(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → H2(g) + MgCl2(aq)

All acids also react at various rates with carbonates (e.g., Na2CO3(aq) and
CaCO3(s)) in a double displacement reaction producing carbonic acid,
H2CO3(aq). To clean up spills, emergency response teams often use a mixture of
chemicals that includes sodium carbonate. The carbonic acid produced is
unstable and decomposes quickly to form carbon dioxide and water.

acid + carbonate → H2CO3(aq) + ionic compound
→ CO2(g) + H2O(l) + ionic compound

For example:

2 HNO3(aq) + Na2CO3(s) → CO2(g) + H2O(l) + 2 NaNO3(aq)

Finally, acids react with bases in another double displacement reaction often
called a neutralization reaction. The result of this reaction is that the pH of the
solution moves toward seven. Emergency response teams might test the pH of a
spill with pH paper and then monitor the neutralization of the spill by repeated
tests with pH paper.

strong acid + strong base → water + ionic compound

For example:

HCl(aq) + KOH(aq) → H2O(l) + KCl(aq)
H�(aq) + Cl

�
(aq) + K

�
(aq) + OH

�
(aq) → H2O(l) + K

�
(aq) + Cl

�
(aq) (total ionic equation)

H�(aq) + OH
�
(aq) → H2O(l) (net ionic equation)

or    H3O
�
(aq) + OH

�
(aq) → 2 H2O(l) (net ionic equation)

Although not a defining property of acids, acids also undergo precipitation reac-
tions with some ionic compounds. Instead of a double displacement neutralization

The first thing the emergency crew must do
is identify the spilled chemical.

reaction, a double displacement precipitation reaction occurs. For example, we
can determine the concentration of hydroiodic acid by reacting the solution with
aqueous lead(II) nitrate and measuring the mass of precipitate formed.

acid + ionic compound → precipitate + acid

2 HI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 HNO3(aq)

2. (a) A spill of hydrobromic acid can be neutralized by reacting it with
zinc, lye, and/or washing soda. Write chemical equations to rep-
resent each of these reactions individually. (Common names are
given in Appendix C.)

(b) List advantages and/or disadvantages for each of the neutraliza-
tion methods above.

3. Oxalic acid, H2C2O4(aq), found in foods such as rhubarb, undergoes
typical acid reactions. Write chemical equations to represent the fol-
lowing reactions.
(a) Oxalic acid reacts with an aluminum cooking pot to make it look

shinier. Assume that one product is an oxalate (low solubility).
(b) Oxalic acid reacts with aqueous calcium, say, calcium chloride in

your blood, to produce insoluble crystals of calcium oxalate that
can grow to become bladder or kidney stones.

(c) The high oxalic acid content in spinach reacts with the high iron
content in spinach to precipitate iron (III) ions out during diges-
tion as, for example, iron(III) oxalate. Assume that the iron in the
stomach appears as iron(III) chloride. How does this destroy the
myth of Popeye getting his strength from iron in spinach?

Acid–Base Titration

Titration is a common laboratory technique used to determine the concentration
of substances in solution. It is a reliable, efficient, and economical technology
that is simple to use. A known volume of the sample to be analyzed is usually
transferred into an Erlenmeyer flask (Figure 2). The solution in the buret (called
the titrant) is added, drop by drop, to the sample. Alternatively, the standard
solution could be in the flask, so the solution of unknown concentration would
be the titrant. The titrant is added drop by drop until the reaction is judged to be
complete. To help us identify this point, we select an indicator that changes
colour when the reaction is complete (Table 1). The point at which the indicator

titration: a laboratory procedure involving
the carefully measured and controlled addi-
tion of a solution from a buret into a meas-
ured volume of a sample solution

titrant: the solution in the buret during a
titration

Figure 2

An initial volume reading is taken before any
titrant is added to the sample solution. Then
titrant is added until the reaction is complete,
that is, when a drop of titrant changes the
colour of the sample. The final buret reading
is then taken. The difference in buret read-
ings is the volume of titrant added.

changes colour is called the endpoint. This is at, or close to, the point at which
the titrant and sample have completely reacted.

Reactions between aqueous reactants are generally fast. If this reaction
involves acids and bases, and at least one of these is strong, then the reaction will
normally proceed as in a balanced chemical equation (be stoichiometric), require
no special conditions (be spontaneous), and be complete (quantitative). These are
the necessary requirements for the use of titration for chemical analysis. Typical
chemical analyses include analysis of acids in the environment (acid deposition
studies), quality control in industrial and commercial operations, and scientific
research. A typical practice titration is the chemical analysis of acetic acid in a
sample of vinegar, using a sodium hydroxide solution in a buret as the titrant.

When you perform a chemical analysis by titration, you will use a number of
volumetric techniques such as using a pipet to transfer portions of the sample for
analysis, the titration using a buret, and measuring solution volumes. In order to
obtain precise and reliable results, you must know the concentration of one of
the reactants; that is, you must use a standard solution.

When doing a titration, you come to a point when the reaction is complete
and the indicator suddenly changes colour: the endpoint. At the endpoint you
stop the titration and record the volume of titrant used. Chemically equivalent
amounts of reactants, as determined by the mole ratio in the balanced chemical
equation, have now been combined.

A titration procedure should involve several trials, using different samples of
the unknown solution to improve the reliability of the answer. A typical require-
ment is to repeat measurements until three trials result in volumes within 0.1 mL
to 0.2 mL of each other. These three results are then averaged before carrying out
further calculations.

Titration Requirements

For titration, a chemical reaction must be

• spontaneous—chemicals react on their own without a continuous addition
of energy

• fast—chemicals react instantaneously when mixed
• quantitative—the reaction is more than 99% complete
• stoichiometric—there is a single, whole number mole ratio of amounts of

reactants and products

Example: Titration of Hydrochloric Acid

Manufacturers of commercial chemicals must ensure that their products meet
certain standards. Quality control technicians are responsible for checking sam-
ples of product to ensure that they are acceptable. For aqueous solutions of acids
such as muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), the concentration of the product must
be within certain limits. Titration is an excellent technique to test concentration.
A sodium carbonate solution can be used as the reagent to analyze the
hydrochloric acid. Suppose 1.59 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na2CO3(s), is
dissolved to make 100.0 mL of a standard solution. Samples (10.00 mL) of this
standard solution are then taken and titrated with the HCl(aq) product, which has
been diluted by a factor of 10. The titration evidence collected is shown in Table
2 (page 396).

SUMMARY

endpoint: the point in a titration at which
a sharp change in a property occurs (e.g., a
colour change)

standard solution: a solution of pre-
cisely and accurately known concentration

To analyze this evidence you first need to calculate the molar concentration
of the sodium carbonate solution.

Now you can start the stoichiometry procedure by writing the balanced chemical
equation. Notice in Table 2 that four trials were done, and the volume in the first
trial is significantly higher than in the others. The volume you use for HCl(aq)
should be your best average, typically three results within ±0.1 mL of each other.
The value, 12.8 mL, is the average of trials 2, 3, and 4. (Keep the unrounded value
in your calculator as usual.) The rest of the stoichiometry procedure follows the
usual steps.

398 Chapter 8

Consumer products are required by law to have the minimum quantity of the
active ingredient listed on the product label. Companies that produce chemical
products usually employ analytical chemists and technicians to monitor the final
product in a process known as quality control. Government consumer affairs
departments also use chemists and technicians to check products, particularly in
response to consumer complaints.

In this investigation, you will be the quality control chemist. You have
received a report that a local high-school cafeteria has been serving watered-
down vinegar to the students. Your purpose is to test the acetic acid concentra-
tion of the vinegar to discover whether it has been diluted (i.e., below the 5.0%
W/V acetic acid indicated on the purchased container). Complete the Analysis
and Evaluation sections of the report.

Question

What is the molar concentration of acetic acid in a sample of vinegar?

Prediction

The manufacturer claims on the label that the vinegar contains 5.0% acetic acid,
which translates into a 0.87 mol/L concentration of acetic acid. The concentra-
tion of acetic acid in the vinegar sample should be the same.

Experimental Design

A sample of vinegar from the school cafeteria is diluted by a factor of 10 to make
a 100.0-mL solution. The diluted solution is titrated with a standard sodium
hydroxide solution using phenolphthalein as the indicator.

water. Find a clip from a movie that involves acids, and
critique the portrayal of its chemistry.

Performance TaskUnit 3

Analysis of ASA
Acetylsalicylic acid, widely known as ASA or Aspirin (Figure 1), is the world’s
most commonly used pain-relieving drug—over ten thousand tonnes are man-
ufactured every year in North America alone. ASA, HC9H7O4(s), is an organic
(carbon chain) acid like acetic acid, HC2H3O2(l), and reacts with strong bases
such as sodium hydroxide in the same way. You will be provided with a standard
solution of NaOH(aq)—one for which the concentration is known with a fair
degree of certainty.

The main purpose of this task is to perform an investigation to accurately
determine the ASA content of an over-the-counter pain reliever, and to compare
the result with the quantity stated on the product label. There are several com-
plicating factors that arise from the nature of ASA tablets:

• All tablet medications contain other “inert” ingredients besides the “medic-
inal” ones—and some of these other ingredients are not soluble.

• ASA is a large molecule with only one OH group to provide hydrogen
bonding, so it is not very soluble in water. The CRC Handbook lists this
compound as soluble in alcohols, ethers, and chloroform.

• Some tablets of this type have special coatings or are “buffered,” meaning
that other compounds are added that can and do interfere with ASA’s reac-
tion as an acid.

The use of a solvent other than water to dissolve your ASA tablet presents
some more complications: There are three alcohols commonly available to the
public. They are methanol, CH3OH(l), ethanol, C2H5OH(l), and isopropanol,
CH3CHOHCH3(l). Methanol is sold as fondue fuel and gas line or windshield
washer antifreeze, often called methyl hydrate. It is quite toxic if ingested, so it is
not usually named as an alcohol for public sale. The idea is not to tempt or con-
fuse consumers into thinking that it is drinkable. The other two alcohols are sold
as “rubbing” alcohols in pharmacies. Note that while ethanol is not toxic in small
quantities, ethanol used in anything other than liquors (alcoholic beverages) has
other additives to make it toxic and undrinkable.

37. A shopper finds a 700-mL spray bottle of “bleach
cleaner” with a label claiming that the product has a
“fresh” scent, contains a powerful cleaner, and that it
kills 99.9% of germs. The fine print states that it con-
tains 1.84 % W/V sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl(aq),
bleach when packed. The “powerful” cleaner is not
identified, so it is probably a non-controlled product
like liquid detergent. Many cleaning solutions have per-
fumes added, so that likely explains the “fresh” scent. A
3.6-L jug of regular household bleach with another
brand name, found on the same shelf, is labelled 5.25%
W/V sodium hypochlorite, when packed.
(a) When bleach bottles are opened, an easily identified

odour of chlorine tells you that some chlorine has
escaped. Explain what this observation tells you
about the tendency of aqueous hypochlorite ions to
react, and why the bottle labels must use the
phrase, “when packed,” when listing the minimum
concentration value of sodium hypochlorite.

(b) What minimum mass of NaOCl(s) was required to
make the bleach solution contained in the large 3.6-L
jug?

(c) If your main purpose is to kill microorganisms, you
could just dilute some regular bleach and wipe your
cutting board, countertop or stove surface. How
many times more NaOCl solute, by mass, is in the
large jug than is in the spray bottle?

(d) Find some bleach solution containers at home or in
the supermarket. Try to find large and small ones
with the same brand name, such as Clorox or Javex.
Record the volumes, concentration, and prices;
compare the two by calculating the cost per gram
of NaOCl in each container.

(e) The shopper notes that both bottles are labelled as
corrosive, and marked with the Hazardous
Household Product Symbol (HHPS) in a triangular
frame. What is the symbol used, and what does the
triangular frame mean?

(f) The labels also say “Dangerous Gas Formed When
Mixed with Acid.” Write the net ionic equation for
hydrogen ions reacting with hypochlorite ions,
OCl –(aq), and chloride ions, to form chlorine gas and
water. Explain why this reaction as written cannot
be considered a simple BrØnsted-Lowry acid–base

are in large print, in black, on a white background. On a
smaller spray bottle of a more dilute solution, the same
words and logo are used, but in small print, in light
green, on a slightly darker green background. Both
containers also state “Dangerous Gas Formed When
Mixed with Acid”—which is a very important cau-
tion—so that people do not try to clean their sinks and
toilets by mixing acids (such as rust-removing cleaners)
with bleach.

stituted for the commercial solution, and checks out a
library reference. The student  finds that the percentage
ionization of a 0.10 mol/L solution of glycolic acid is
3.9%. In Chapter 8, the percentage ionization of a
0.10 mol/L solution of acetic acid (the acid in vinegar)

37. A shopper finds a 700-mL spray bottle of “bleach
cleaner” with a label claiming that the product has a
“fresh” scent, contains a powerful cleaner, and that it
kills 99.9% of germs. The fine print states that it con-
tains 1.84 % W/V sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl(aq),
bleach when packed. The “powerful” cleaner is not
identified, so it is probably a non-controlled product
like liquid detergent. Many cleaning solutions have per-
fumes added, so that likely explains the “fresh” scent. A
3.6-L jug of regular household bleach with another
brand name, found on the same shelf, is labelled 5.25%
W/V sodium hypochlorite, when packed.
(a) When bleach bottles are opened, an easily identified

odour of chlorine tells you that some chlorine has
escaped. Explain what this observation tells you
about the tendency of aqueous hypochlorite ions to
react, and why the bottle labels must use the
phrase, “when packed,” when listing the minimum
concentration value of sodium hypochlorite.

(b) What minimum mass of NaOCl(s) was required to
make the bleach solution contained in the large 3.6-L
jug?

(c) If your main purpose is to kill microorganisms, you
could just dilute some regular bleach and wipe your
cutting board, countertop or stove surface. How
many times more NaOCl solute, by mass, is in the
large jug than is in the spray bottle?

(d) Find some bleach solution containers at home or in
the supermarket. Try to find large and small ones
with the same brand name, such as Clorox or Javex.
Record the volumes, concentration, and prices;
compare the two by calculating the cost per gram
of NaOCl in each container.

(e) The shopper notes that both bottles are labelled as
corrosive, and marked with the Hazardous
Household Product Symbol (HHPS) in a triangular
frame. What is the symbol used, and what does the
triangular frame mean?

(f) The labels also say “Dangerous Gas Formed When
Mixed with Acid.” Write the net ionic equation for
hydrogen ions reacting with hypochlorite ions,
OCl –(aq), and chloride ions, to form chlorine gas and
water. Explain why this reaction as written cannot
be considered a simple BrØnsted-Lowry acid–base
reaction.

TION and ATTENTION, and a HHPS corrosive logo
are in large print, in black, on a white background. On a
smaller spray bottle of a more dilute solution, the same
words and logo are used, but in small print, in light
green, on a slightly darker green background. Both
containers also state “Dangerous Gas Formed When
Mixed with Acid”—which is a very important cau-
tion—so that people do not try to clean their sinks and
toilets by mixing acids (such as rust-removing cleaners)
with bleach.

The Gas State
The photograph in Figure 1 is a dramatic depiction of how a gas can save a
human life. In a car crash, an air bag, especially in combination with a seat belt,
can protect the driver from serious injury. Upon collision, sensors in the steering
column and in the bumper initiate the decomposition of sodium azide into
sodium metal and nitrogen gas. This reaction is extremely fast: Nitrogen gas is
produced and expands into the bag in less than 0.04 s. After cushioning the
impact, the air bag gradually deflates as the nitrogen gas escapes through the per-
meable bag. Instead of taking a trip to the hospital, the driver takes a trip to the
automobile body shop to have the air bag mechanism recharged and the trig-
gering devices reset.

Air bags are not the only use of gases in the operation of automobiles: Tires
and shock absorbers are inflated with pressurized air to provide a safe and com-
fortable ride. Air enters through the car’s vents and is cooled by the air condi-
tioner to keep us comfortable on hot summer days or is heated by the car engine
to keep us warm in winter. Inside the combustion cylinders of the engine, a gaso-
line and oxygen explosion produces a large amount of gas at high temperature,
which moves a piston. This is an example of converting chemical energy into
motion. Finally, the gases emitted by automobile exhausts, such as carbon oxides
and nitrogen oxides, diffuse into the atmosphere as pollutants.

As you can see, gases play an important role in both technology and our nat-
ural environment. In this chapter, you will learn more about the properties and
uses of gases.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

and SATP), absolute or Kelvin
temperature, and ideal gas;

418 Chapter 9

9.1 States of Matter
The empirical properties (Table 1) of the three states of matter—solid, liquid,
gas—provide important clues about the nature and structure of matter. At the
same temperature some substances are solids, some are liquids, and some are
gases. This suggests that the forces between the particles that make up the sub-
stance vary in strength. Unlike liquids and gases, solids maintain their shape and
volume (Figure 1). This evidence suggests that the forces between the particles in
the solid are strong; in fact, these forces are the strongest of the three states. At
room temperature, all ionic compounds and all metals (except mercury) are
solid. Some molecular substances, including both molecular elements and com-
pounds, can also be in the solid state. The ionic bonds in ionic compounds, inter-
molecular forces in some molecular substances, covalent bonds in covalent
crystals, and metallic bonds in metallic substances all provide strong attractions
that bond the particles tightly together. Strong bonds are also believed to prevent
solids from flowing easily, since this would require particles to be able to slip past
one another. Strong bonds would also suggest that there are few empty spaces
between the particles, and this would explain why solids are difficult to compress.

Table 1: Empirical Properties of States of Matter

State Properties Example

solid • solids have definite shape and 
volume 

• are virtually incompressible
• do not flow easily

liquid • liquids assume the shape of 
the container but have a 
definite volume 

• are virtually incompressible
• flow readily

gas • gases assume the shape and 
volume of the container 

• are highly compressible 
• flow readily

The Gas State 419

9.1

At room temperature, most liquids are molecular compounds. This evidence
plus their generally low boiling points suggest that the intermolecular forces
(dipole–dipole, London, and hydrogen bonding) are not as strong as ionic, cova-
lent, or metallic bonds. However, in these liquids, the intermolecular forces must
be sufficiently strong to hold the molecules closely together but not locked in
place, allowing them to move past one another. Therefore, the molecules in a
liquid can spread out to take the shape of the container while keeping their
volume constant (Figure 2). Because gases have no definite shape or volume
(Figure 3), there appears to be an absence of forces between the molecules in a
gas.

Atomic theory predicts that noble gases are composed of monatomic mole-
cules (e.g., Ne(g)). Since these molecules are nonpolar, intermolecular force theory
suggests that any attraction between noble gas molecules must be explained by
London (dispersion) forces. The larger the noble gas molecule, the larger the
London forces, due to the larger number of electrons per molecule. Similarly, the
intermolecular attractions between diatomic molecules of elements, for example,
H2(g) and Cl2(g), can be explained by London forces. The van der Waals attraction
between diatomic molecules of compounds, for example, HCl(g) and CO(g), is
explained as being a combination of London and dipole–dipole forces. In general,
because of large intermolecular distances in a gas, hydrogen bonding is not pos-
sible between gas molecules.

An attempt to explain the states of matter based only on the strengths of
forces fails when considering how solids can be changed to liquids and liquids
changed to gases by increasing the temperature. The reverse changes in state also
occur when the temperature decreases. The strengths of bonds between mole-
cules cannot be the complete explanation for the different states. To more com-
pletely understand the states of matter, we must also consider the motion of the
molecules.

The Kinetic Molecular Theory

How would you explain why a drop of food colouring added to a glass of cold
water slowly spreads out, or diffuses, throughout the water? How would you
explain why the amount of water in an open container slowly decreases as some
of the water evaporates? For the first question, scientists would say that the mol-
ecules of food colouring and the molecules of water are moving and colliding
with each other, and this causes them to mix. The answer to the second question
is also molecular motion: Some of the water molecules in the open container
obtain sufficient energy from collisions to escape from the liquid. The idea of
molecular motion that is used to explain these observations has led to the kinetic
molecular theory, which has become a cornerstone of modern science.

The fundamental idea of the kinetic molecular theory is that solids, liquids,
and gases are composed of particles that are continually moving and colliding
with other particles. These particles may be atoms, ions, or molecules. As they
move about, they collide with each other and with objects in their path. Very tiny
objects, such as pollen grains or specks of smoke, are buffeted by these particles
in air and move erratically, as shown in Figure 4.

There are three types of motion that any particle can exhibit: translational
(straight-line), rotational (spinning), and vibrational (back-and-forth motion of
atoms within the molecule). Which type of motion predominates depends on
the freedom of movement of the particles; this, in turn, depends on the strengths
of the forces between the particles. If particles are restricted to mainly vibrational
motion, as in solids, then particles stay together in a relatively ordered state

kinetic molecular theory: the idea
that all substances contain particles that are
in constant, random motion

Figure 4

Observation of microscopic particles such as
pollen grains or specks of smoke shows a
continuous, random motion known as
Brownian motion, named for Scottish scien-
tist Robert Brown (1773–1858), who first
described it. Scientists’ interpretations of this
evidence led to the formation of the kinetic
molecular theory.

Atmospheres

The Earth has an atmosphere, Saturn’s moon
Titan has an atmosphere, but the Moon does
not. Why? This can be explained, at least par-
tially, by kinetic molecular theory and gravita-
tional attraction. The higher the temperature,
the faster the particles in an atmosphere
would move. The faster they move, the more
likely they are to escape the pull of the body’s
gravity. (Molecules, like rockets, must reach
escape velocity to leave an atmosphere.) Cool
bodies are more likely to have an atmosphere,
as are massive bodies, which pull more
strongly on atmospheric particles. The Earth
and Moon are the same distance from the
Sun. Without an atmosphere their tempera-
tures would be roughly the same. However,
Earth is much more massive than the Moon,
and so can retain an atmosphere. Saturn’s
moon Titan, although its mass is less than

(Figure 5). Liquids with some of each type of motion remain largely together but
in a more jumbled, less orderly state. Gas molecules rotate and vibrate but their
translational (straight-line) motion is most significant. This produces random
collisions and the most disordered state with no organization.

Any moving object has energy called kinetic energy. A moving car, bird, and
molecule all have kinetic energy. The faster the motion of an object, the greater
its kinetic energy. Because the molecules of a substance are always colliding, at
any instant some molecules are moving faster than others. Therefore, in a large
group of molecules, there will be a range of kinetic energies from very low to very
high values. The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic
energy of its particles. If a substance is heated, its temperature rises until a change
of state occurs. As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the
particles increases and, on average, each particle moves faster and has more
kinetic energy. When the average kinetic energy exceeds a particular (threshold)
energy, a substance changes state; for example, melts or boils. The high-energy
particles escape, and with a constant energy input from the outside of the system,
the temperature remains constant until the change of state is complete.

Explaining the Gas State

Theoretical chemists have created theories to explain the empirical properties of
the gas state. They explain that for solids and liquids, the intermolecular forces
hold the particles together. These forces of attraction are opposed by forces of
repulsion when the particles get too close together. We say that the particles col-
lide. If the intermolecular forces are relatively strong and the kinetic energy is rel-
atively low, then a condensed state is favoured. The properties of gases (Table 1)
suggest that the intermolecular forces are virtually nonexistent. Consider a closed
bottle of perfume. Initially, the perfume molecules are contained within the
bottle. If the bottle is opened in a closed room, some of the perfume molecules
that are continually escaping from the solution through evaporation can now
leave the open bottle. The perfume gas molecules will slowly diffuse throughout
their new container—the room. Opening the door allows the perfume molecules
to eventually occupy the whole building. And opening the front door of the
building means that the perfume gas molecules can diffuse into the atmosphere,
a very large container. There does not appear to be a limit to the diffusion of gas
molecules as long as they do not react with other substances. Based on this evi-
dence and other properties of gases (e.g., lack of a definite shape), we will assume
that there are no attractive forces between gas molecules and that the molecules
move in straight lines independently of each other. This is a very good approxi-
mation when starting the study of gases.

Figure 5

According to the kinetic molecular theory, the
motion of molecules is different in solids, liq-
uids, and gases. Particles in solids have pri-
marily vibrational motion; particles in liquids
have vibrational, rotational, and translational
motion; and the most important form of
motion in gases is translational.

Expansion upon Heating

Most solids, liquids, and gases expand (their
density decreases) when the temperature
increases. This is explained as an increase in
the average kinetic energy of the particles,
which carries the particles farther apart
before the intermolecular forces can pull
them back. Of course, the increase in density
when ice melts is explained differently. Do
you know the explanation?

Models in science are used to describe abstract ideas and make them easier to
understand. Some models are mathematical (e.g., mathematical models of
motion describing falling bodies), some are mechanical (e.g., model cars and
trains), and some are physical (e.g., physical models of the biological cell). It is
important to remember that all models have limitations. The model is good if
the descriptions, explanations, and predictions it gives for natural phenomena
outweigh its limitations.

In this activity, you will use a molecular motion demonstrator to better visu-
alize and understand the models of solids, liquids, and gases.

Materials

Procedure

1. Set the molecular motion demonstrator on the overhead projector and
place the watch glass inside the metal square. Add some plastic spheres to
the watch glass.

2. Turn on the power to the demonstrator and set it to low speed. Observe
and record the shape and volume of the whole sample and the motion of
the individual spheres.

3. Slowly increase the speed until the spheres start to leave the main group.
Observe and record the characteristics of the sample and the individual
spheres.

4. Remove the watch glass and place the plastic spheres inside the main com-
partment. Slowly increase the speed until it is at the maximum setting.
Record your observations.

Analysis

(a) How does the molecular model demonstrator simulate the attractive forces
between particles of a solid or liquid?

(b) Based on your observations, describe the degree of order or organization of
the particles in each model of the three states of matter.

Synthesis

(c) Evaluate the ability of this model to represent the molecular motion within
solids, liquids, and gases.

(d) How could you use this model to show diffusion within a liquid or gas? the
compressibility of gases?

Distances Between Molecules

In a molecular solid, the distance between
molecules is about the same size as the mol-
ecules themselves; in a liquid it is slightly
greater; and in a gas the distance between
molecules is about 20 to 30 times the size of
the molecules. To picture yourself as a par-
ticle in a solid, imagine yourself seated in a
regular classroom. For a liquid, picture a
school dance. For a gas, imagine yourself and
three friends skating randomly at the Air
Canada Centre.

Pressure and Volume: Boyle’s Law

We live at the bottom of an ocean of air. That air has many different properties
that can be altered experimentally in a laboratory, including temperature and
pressure (properties familiar to us from weather reports), volume, and amount
of gas. In any controlled experiment, the plan is to manipulate one variable and
observe its effect on another variable while keeping all other properties constant.
We begin our study of gases by looking at the relationship between pressure and
volume at a constant temperature and amount of gas.

Earth’s gravity exerts a downward force on you, and you, in turn, exert an
equal force on the ground. However, the force you exert can be distributed over
a large or a small area. The area is large when you lie down, and small when you
stand on the tips of your toes. The greater the area, the lower the pressure. For
example, when you wear snowshoes, the force is distributed over the surface area
of the snowshoe, so you exert less pressure on the ground directly below your feet
than you would if you were wearing regular shoes. This allows you to walk over
snow instead of sinking into it. Pressure of a gas is also force per unit area, but in
this case the force is exerted by the moving molecules as they collide with objects
in their path, particularly the walls of a container.

Scientists have agreed, internationally, on units, symbols, and standard
values for pressure. The SI unit for pressure, pascal (Pa), represents a force of 1 N
(newton) on an area of 1 m2; 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. Atmospheric pressure and the pres-
sure of many gases are often more conveniently measured in kilopascals (kPa);
1 kPa = 1000 Pa = 1 kN/m2 (exactly).

At sea level, average atmospheric pressure is about 101 kPa. Scientists used
this value as a basis to define one standard atmosphere (1 atm), or standard pres-
sure, as exactly 101.325 kPa. For convenience, standard ambient pressure has been
more recently defined as exactly 100 kPa.

For many years, standard conditions for work with gases were a temperature
of 0°C and a pressure of 1 atm (101.325 kPa); these conditions are known as
standard temperature and pressure (STP). However, 0°C is not a convenient tem-
perature, because laboratory temperatures are not close to 0°C. Scientists have
since agreed to use another set of standard conditions, not only for gases but also
for reporting the properties of other substances. The new standard is called stan-
dard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP), defined as 25°C and 100 kPa.
The new standard is much closer to laboratory conditions.

Since the empirical properties of gases were measured long before the devel-
opment of SI, pressure of gas has been expressed in a bewildering variety of units
over the years. In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli (1608–1647), following up on a sug-
gestion from Galileo, accidentally invented a way of measuring atmospheric
pressure. He was investigating Aristotle’s notion that nature abhors a vacuum.
His experimental design involved inverting a glass tube filled with mercury and
placing it into a tub also containing mercury (Figure 1). Noticing that the mer-
cury level changed from day to day, he realized that his device, which came to be
called a mercury barometer, was a means of measuring atmospheric pressure. In
Torricelli’s honour, standard pressure was at one time defined as 760 torr, or
760 mm Hg. (Mercury vapour is toxic; in modern mercury barometers, a thin
film of water or oil is added to prevent the evaporation of mercury from the open
reservoir.)

pressure: force per unit area

atmospheric pressure: the force per
unit area exerted by air on all objects

Standard Pressure

Another way to think about standard pres-
sure is as the equivalent to the weight of one
kilogram resting on every square centimetre
of your body.

Many areas of study that employ gases, such as medicine and meteorology,

units (Table 2). Using the definitions in Table 2, it is possible to easily convert

Figure 1

When a tube filled with mercury is inverted,
the weight of the column of mercury pulls it
toward Earth. However, the weight of air
directly above the open dish pushes down on
the surface of the mercury and prevents all of
the mercury from falling out of the tube. The
two opposing forces—weight of mercury and
weight of air—balance each other when the
height of mercury is about 760 mm. If the
tube of mercury is longer than 760 mm, the
mercury drops, leaving a vacuum above. Why
is mercury used in most barometers, and not
other liquids such as water, which is plentiful
and nontoxic? The answer is density:
Mercury is much denser than water. The
weight of air in the atmosphere will support
a column of water about 10 m high, which
might be difficult to fit in a room!

Be as specific as possible.

The Relationship Between Pressure and Volume

Analysis of the evidence produced in an investigation similar to Investigation
9.2.1 suggests an inverse variation between the pressure and the volume of a gas;
that is, as the pressure increases, the volume decreases (Figure 3). Using the evi-
dence given in SI units in Table 4, you can see that when the pressure is doubled
(100 kPa to 200 kPa), the volume is halved (3.00 L to 1.50 L). If the pressure is
tripled, the volume is reduced to one-third. Check the other values to see similar
results.

If p1 and v1 represent the initial conditions, the other values of pressure and
volume from Table 4 may be stated as follows:

(p1, v1) (2p1,
�

�v1) (3p1,
�

3

�v1) (4p1,
�

4

�v1) (5p1,
�

5

�v1)

For all the conditions listed above, the product of the pressure and volume
is equal to p1v1. Mathematically, the relationship is represented as pv = k, where
k is a constant. This simple relationship was first determined by Robert Boyle in
1662 (Figure 4, page 428). Boyle’s law states that as the pressure on a gas increases,
the volume of the gas decreases proportionally, provided that the temperature and
amount of gas remain constant. In other words, the volume of a gas is inversely
proportional to the pressure of the gas, providing that the temperature and
amount of gas are held constant. Boyle’s law can be conveniently written com-
paring any two sets of pressure and volume measurements:

p1v1 = p2v2 (Boyle’s law)

This can also be expressed as a calculation of a new pressure inversely related
to the volumes ratio:

helped him construct an air pump. Using this
necessary technology, Boyle demonstrated
the physical characteristics of air and the
necessary role of air in combustion, respira-
tion, and the transmission of sound. In 1661,
he reported to the Royal Society on the rela-
tionship now known as Boyle’s law. Boyle
became so famous that foreign academics
wouldn’t consider a trip to England complete
until they had met him. He was elected presi-

Volume and Temperature: Charles’s Law

More than a century after Boyle had determined the relationship between the
volume and pressure of a gas, French physicist Jacques Charles (Figure 6) deter-
mined the relationship between the volume and temperature of a gas. Charles
became interested in the effect of temperature on gas volume after observing the
hot-air balloons that had become popular as flying machines.

The purpose of this investigation is to determine how the temperature and
volume of a gas are related. Complete the Analysis and Evaluation sections of
the lab report.

Question

What effect does increasing the temperature have on the volume of a gas?

Experimental Design

A volume of air is sealed inside a syringe, which is then placed in a water bath.
As the temperature of the water (independent variable) is changed, the volume
of air (dependent variable) is measured. The amount of gas inside the syringe
and the pressure on the gas are two controlled variables.

Investigation 9.2.2; however, if the two variables are graphed as in Figure 8(a), a
straight line is obtained, so a simple relationship does exist. When the line is
extrapolated downward, it meets the horizontal axis at –273°C. It appears that, if
the gas did not liquefy, its volume would become zero at –273°C. If this experi-
ment is repeated with different quantities of gas or with samples of different
gases, straight-line relationships between temperature and volume are also
observed. When the lines are extrapolated, they all meet at –273°C, as shown in
Figure 8(b). This temperature, called absolute zero, is the lowest possible tem-
perature. Scientists with sophisticated technology are coming within an increas-
ingly smaller fraction of a degree from absolute zero.

Absolute zero is the basis of another temperature scale, called the absolute or
Kelvin temperature scale. On the Kelvin scale, absolute zero (–273°C) is zero
kelvin (0 K), as shown in Figure 8(b). (Note that no degree symbol is used for
kelvin.) To convert degrees Celsius to kelvin, add 273 (Figure 9, page 432). STP
and SATP are each defined by two exact values with infinite significant digits
(i.e., STP is 273.15 K and 101.325 kPa; SATP is 298.15 K and 100 kPa). For con-
venience, however, use STP as 273 K and 101 kPa and SATP as 298 K and 100 kPa.
Several other values are commonly rounded off to three significant digits for cal-
culation purposes; for example, Avogadro’s number, 6.02 × 1023.

Lord Kelvin

Sir William Thomson (1824–1907), also
known as Lord Kelvin, was a Scottish engi-
neer, mathematician, and physicist who pro-
foundly influenced the scientific thought of
his generation. His contributions to science
included the absolute temperature scale
(measured in kelvin). The style and character
of Thomson’s scientific and engineering work
reflected his active personality. While a stu-
dent at the University of Cambridge, he was
awarded silver sculls for winning the univer-
sity championship in racing single-seater
rowing shells. He was a traveller all of his
life; he spent much time in Europe and made
several trips to the United States. Thomson
risked his life several times during the laying
of the first transatlantic cable.

Charles’s Law

The relationship in kelvin between the volume and temperature of a gas is shown
in Figure 8(b). This relationship is described as a direct variation; that is, as the
temperature increases, the volume increases. Mathematically, this relationship is
represented as

v = kT

where T represents the temperature in kelvin. This means that the quotient of the
two variables (v/T) has a constant value (k), which is the slope of the straight-line
graph (Figure 8(b)). A constant value is clearly shown by the analysis in Table 5.

The relationship between volume and absolute temperature is known as
Charles’s law, which states that, as the temperature of a gas increases, the volume
increases proportionally, provided that the pressure and amount of gas remain con-
stant (Figure 10). Charles’s law can be conveniently written comparing any two
sets of volume and temperature measurements:

The Combined Gas Law

When Boyle’s, Charles’s, and the pressure–temperature laws are combined, the
resulting combined gas law states the relationship among the volume, tempera-
ture, and pressure of any fixed amount of gas:

Boyle’s law: pv � a constant (T and n are controlled variables)

Charles’s law: �
T

v
� � a constant (p and n are controlled variables)

pressure–temperature law: �
T

p
� = a constant (v and n are controlled variables)

If the product pv is constant at a fixed temperature, then p(�T
v

�) should also be a
constant because v divided by a constant temperature is also constant. If the tem-
perature changes, then Charles’s law tells us that the ratio �T

v
� is constant at a fixed

pressure. Therefore, multiplying a constant pressure by a constant ratio of
volume to temperature certainly produces a number that is a constant.
Alternatively, you could employ the same reasoning using Boyle’s and the pres-
sure and temperature laws to again show that (�T

p
�)v must also be constant. Using

this reasoning or a mathematical method of joint variation, we can conclude that
the product of the pressure and volume of a gas divided by its absolute temper-
ature is a constant as long as the amount of gas is controlled, that is, does not
change:

�

The combined gas law is a useful starting point for all cases involving pres-
sure, volume, and temperature, even if one of these variables is constant (as in
Boyle’s, Charles’s, and the pressure–temperature laws). A variable that is constant
can easily be eliminated from the combined gas law equation. For example, a
steel cylinder with a fixed volume contains a gas at a pressure of 652 kPa and a
temperature of 25˚C. If the cylinder is heated to 150˚C, what will be the new pres-
sure? Because the volume is constant, we can cancel v1 and v2 from the combined

sphere to which a pressure gauge is attached.
Because the gas inside the sphere cannot
expand, the relationship between temperature
and pressure of a gas can be determined.



9.3 Compressed Gases
Not only are gases a major part of our lives, but compressed gases, that is, gases
at pressures above atmospheric pressure, are particularly useful:

• The tires of vehicles contain pressurized air.
• Many people use gas barbecues with a pressurized propane fuel tank.
• Aerosol cans contain a propellant that carries the contents of the can out

the nozzle; the propellant is a pressurized gas.
• Major surgery usually involves oxygen administered from a pressurized

oxygen tank and is often accompanied by an anesthetic, which may also be
a pressurized gas, such as dinitrogen monoxide.

Certain occupations require some work with pressurized gases. In the med-
ical field, paramedics and doctors use oxygen tanks. Firefighters use compressed
air tanks like those used by underwater divers. Some welders use oxyacetylene
torches (Figure 1). This form of welding requires both a pressurized oxygen tank
and a pressurized acetylene tank. Many scientists and their graduate students
routinely use pressurized gases for research because the gas is part of the reaction
system or because it provides an inert (nonreactive) environment. Noble gases,
such as argon, are also used to provide an inert environment in the computer
chip industry, where oxygen would cause undesirable reactions.

The chemical safety hazards of some gases are similar to those of many other
chemicals, which may be corrosive, toxic, flammable, dangerously reactive, or
oxidizing agents. What makes compressed gases much more dangerous is the
physical hazard of a potential rocket. In commercial gas cylinders, gas pressures
can be as high as 15 MPa (about 150 atm). The hole in the tank, to which the
valve stem and valve are connected, is the diameter of a pencil. If the gas is sud-
denly released through such a small opening, the very great pressure propels the
tank, making it a formidable projectile. If the tank is mishandled, dropped, or
falls over and the valve stem breaks, the tank can fly through solid brick walls and
cause considerable damage.

442 Chapter 9

Professional and recreational underwater divers face risks associated with
the use of a pressurized air tank or scuba (self-contained underwater breathing
apparatus). The tank containing compressed air is attached to a regulator that
releases the air at the same pressure as the underwater surroundings (Figure 2).
The pressure underwater can be quite substantial. Breathing pressurized air is
necessary to balance the internal and external pressures on the chest to allow
divers to inflate their lungs. However, this creates problems if divers ascend to
normal pressure too quickly or while holding their breath. According to Boyle’s
law, if the pressure is decreased, the volume of air increases. When the volume of
air is contained in the lungs, the lungs would expand to accommodate the
increased volume, but this is very dangerous because the lungs could rupture.
This is one reason why a person needs an understanding of gases and gas laws in
order to obtain a scuba-diving licence and to dive safely.

Another problem of breathing air under pressure is that it forces more air to
dissolve in the diver’s bloodstream. If the diver comes up too quickly, the solu-
bility of air (mostly nitrogen) decreases as the pressure decreases, and nitrogen
bubbles form in the blood vessels. These nitrogen bubbles are the cause of a
diving danger called “the bends” (so named because divers typically bend over in
agony as they try to relieve the pain). Nitrogen bubbles are especially dangerous
if they form in the brain or spinal cord. The bends may be avoided by ascending
very slowly or corrected by using a decompression chamber.

(b) Why is this a dangerous situation?
(c) What assumption is made for the calculation in (a)?

4. Suggest a chemical or physical reason why pressure regulators,
which control the release of a gas from a pressurized tank, are

lator marked “oxygen” should be used on oxygen tanks.

5. Helium has many uses (Figure 3) but one that is familiar to many
people is its use in party balloons. Sometimes people inhale helium
because it produces an unusual change in a person’s voice. In a para-

9.4 The Ideal Gas Law
In this book, all real gases are dealt with in calculations as if they were ideal. An
ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys all the gas laws perfectly under all con-
ditions; that is, it does not condense into a liquid when cooled, and graphs of its
volume and temperature and of its pressure and temperature relationships are
perfectly straight lines. A single, ideal gas equation describes the relationship
among pressure, temperature, volume, and amount of matter, the four variables
that define an ideal gaseous system.

• According to Boyle’s law, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to
the pressure: v ∝ 1/p.

• According to Charles’s law, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to
the absolute temperature: v ∝ T.

• According to the pressure–temperature law, the pressure of a gas is directly
proportional to the absolute kelvin temperature: p ∝ T.

• As anyone knows who has blown up a balloon, the more air you blow into
the balloon, the bigger it gets; in other words, the greater the amount of air,
in moles, at the same temperature and pressure, the greater the volume.
Therefore, v ∝ n.

Combining the three mathematical relationships for the volume of a gas
produces the following relationship:

v ∝ �

� × T × n

Another way of stating this is

v = (constant, R) × �
p

� × T × n

pv = nRT

This last equation is known as the ideal gas law, and the constant R is
known as the gas constant. The value for the gas constant is obtained by substi-
tuting known values into the ideal gas law and solving for R. For example, refer-
ences state that at STP, 1.00 mol of an ideal gas would occupy a volume of
22.414 L.

As with several other constant values used for calculations in this book, a cer-

stant depends on the units chosen to measure volume, pressure, and
temperature. If any three of the four variables in the ideal gas law are known, the
fourth can be calculated by means of this equation. However, often the mass of a
gas is a known quantity. In this case, a two-step calculation is required.

For example, 0.78 g of hydrogen at 22°C and 125 kPa is produced. What
volume of hydrogen would be expected? To use the ideal gas law, you first need

In 1873, Johannes Diderik van der Waals
(1837–1923) hypothesized the existence of
attraction between gas molecules to explain
deviations from the ideal gas law. The gen-
eral attraction, called van der Waals forces,
was later explained as being London forces
by Fritz London and dipole–dipole forces by,
for example, Peter Debye.

Procedure

1. Determine the initial mass of the butane lighter.

2. Pour water into the bucket until it is two-thirds full. Then completely fill
the graduated cylinder with water; invert the graduated cylinder in the
bucket. Ensure that no air has been trapped in the cylinder.

3. Hold the butane lighter in the water under the graduated cylinder
(Figure 2) and release the gas until you have collected half to three-
quarters of the cylinder. Make sure all the bubbles enter the cylinder.

4. Equalize the pressures inside and outside the cylinder by adjusting the
position of the cylinder until the water levels inside and outside the
cylinder are the same.

5. Read the measurement on the cylinder and record the volume of gas col-
lected. Record the ambient (room) temperature and pressure. Record your
measurements as precisely as possible with the equipment available.

Synthesis

(i) Evaluating the evidence from an experiment is not an easy task, and it is
possible to omit a source of experimental error. In this experiment, you
may or may not have realized that the gas you collected is not completely
pure butane. It also contains a small quantity of water vapour. For a typical
room temperature, this would correspond to about 2.6 kPa of the pressure
you recorded. Subtract this value from the pressure you used, and use the
new pressure to recalculate the molar mass and the percentage difference.
Is your answer significantly more accurate?

(j) Are there any other possible sources of error? For example, what assump-
tion must be made about the butane from the lighter or canister you used?

9.5 Air Quality
Air quality, like water quality, has often been taken for granted. Increasingly, both
have come under public scrutiny as the quality of these two requirements of life
has deteriorated. The Ontario Medical Association estimates that 1900 people die
prematurely each year in Ontario due to poor air quality, and almost $10 billion
a year is spent in health-care costs, lost work time, and other quantifiable
expenses resulting from poor air quality. In southern Ontario, the number of
“smog alert days” has increased dramatically over the past few years, and the
recorded asthma rate in children has increased by 60% in the past decade. Young
children, the elderly, and people with respiratory illnesses are particularly at risk.
Public opinion polls commissioned by the Ontario Clean Air Alliance in March
1999 in each of the Hamilton, London, and Kitchener–Waterloo regions showed
that approximately 70% (of the 400 adult respondents) were concerned about air
pollution, and 80% thought that the problem would continue to get worse in the
future. Less than 10% gave the Ontario government a positive rating for its
efforts in controlling air pollution, and more than 85% were willing to pay higher
utility bills to lower emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants.
Although industry, particularly the electric power plants, is a major source of air
pollution, the transportation choices made by citizens are also a significant part
of the air pollution problem.

Although the composition of air is well known (Table 1), its chemistry is
very complex and not completely understood. Many of the chemical processes
taking place in the atmosphere are induced by solar radiation and are inter-
twined with chemical processes—both naturally occurring and as a result of
human activities. However, it is becoming apparent that the human activities are
producing dangerous levels of air pollutants, particularly in large urban areas.
Primary air pollutants include

• gases such as various nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide;
• vapours from volatile organic compounds (VOCs);
• heavy metals and other toxic and carcinogenic substances emitted prima-

rily during the combustion of coal.

An important secondary air pollutant is ground-level ozone formed when
nitrogen oxides and VOCs react in sunlight. According to the Canadian Council
of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), the Windsor–Quebec City corridor
has one of the worst ozone problems in the country. This section focuses on
some of the chemistry of nitrogen and VOCs in the atmosphere and their role in
the formation of ground-level ozone.

The Nitrogen Cycle in Nature

Nitrogen is an important element in living systems (Figure 1, page 450). Before
atmospheric nitrogen can be absorbed by plants, it must be converted into com-
pounds suitable for assimilation. The conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into
nitrates by various microorganisms in the soil (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) and in
the roots of certain plants (legumes, e.g., beans and peas) is called nitrogen fixa-
tion. Lightning is another natural source of nitrogen compounds for plants. At the
high temperature of a lightning strike, nitrogen and oxygen react to produce
nitrogen oxides, which react with water to form nitrous and nitric acids. These
acids are converted to nitrites and nitrates in the soil. Decaying plants and ani-
mals and animal waste products are in turn acted on by bacteria, and the nitrogen
in them is again made available for circulation as nitrogen in the atmosphere.

Ground-Level Ozone

Ozone, O3(g), near the surface (as opposed to the ozone layer high in the atmos-
phere) is a component of smog and one of the most important health concerns
of polluted air. Ozone is produced near the surface when nitrogen oxides and
VOCs react in the presence of sunlight. The human activities of transportation,
generating electricity, and industrial combustion have greatly increased the
amount of nitrogen oxides, NOx (e.g., N2O(g), NO(g), NO2(g), N2O4(g)), produced
annually in Canada. In 1995, transportation accounted for about 58% of NOx,
energy production 12%, and industries 24%. Total emissions of NOx in Ontario
were 538 t in 1995, rising to 565 t in 1998 (CCME Annual Progress Report, 1999).
In August 2000, Ontario’s Anti-Smog Action Plan committed the province to a
45% reduction of NOx and VOCs by the year 2010. Although this sounds prom-
ising, many environmental groups seriously question whether actual reductions
will occur. For example, Ontario Power Generation (formerly Ontario Hydro)
has already claimed a reduction of 19 kt of NOx when in fact its emissions have
increased. The claimed reduction is possible when Ontario Power Generation
buys emission credits from another industry that has earned these credits. Ways
to earn credits are by improving energy efficiency and by adding pollution-

reduction technologies. It is possible to gain credits by expanding operations
without increasing NOx emissions (i.e., the NOx emissions don’t actually have to
be reduced).

The production of nitrogen oxides from human activities begins with the
combustion of nitrogen. Nitrogen monoxide, NO(g), is produced whenever fuel
is burned in air at a high temperature, for example, in an internal combustion
engine. The higher the flame temperature, the more NO(g) is produced:

N2(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO(g)

When released into the atmosphere, the colourless nitrogen monoxide rapidly
reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide, a reddish-brown gas with an irri-
tating odour. The brownish colour of the air in a smog-bound city is due to
NO2(g) (Figure 2):

2 NO(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO2(g)

colourless reddish-brown

In addition to being a toxic chemical, NO2(g) plays a central role in the pro-
duction of ground-level ozone. Sunlight at short wavelengths (ultraviolet region)
causes the decomposition of NO2(g):

NO2(g)
UV light
→ NO(g) + O(g)

The atomic oxygen formed is highly reactive and reacts with molecular oxygen
to form ozone:

O(g) + O2(g) → O3(g)

Volatile organic compounds also contribute to the formation of ground-level
ozone. Hydrocarbons containing carbon–carbon double bonds (C�C) are the
most reactive VOCs. Once again, human activity is a significant source of this
pollutant, with transportation, industrial processes, and commercial activities
the main contributors. Although trees are by far the largest source of VOCs in
Canada, human activities produce high concentrations of VOCs in relatively
small, localized environments. This is where the problems are created. For
example, when gasoline is pumped into a car, the smell of gasoline is evident and
“wavy lines” are often visible in the air at the pump nozzle; this indicates that
gasoline vapours are in the air. Other sources of VOCs include any products or
paints that use solvents that evaporate, wood burning, dry cleaners, paint shops,
and various industries (Figure 3, page 452).

Ozone is produced by a series of complex reactions involving VOCs, NO,
and oxygen under the influence of sunlight. In summary,

VOC + NO(g) + O2(g) → O3(g) + HNO3(aq) + oxidized organics

Although formed in urban areas, the pollutants NOx, VOCs, and O3(g) can travel
considerable distances in the atmosphere. This causes problems because they
pollute regions that do not have high emissions or further aggravate areas that
are already suffering from excess emissions, such as the Windsor–Quebec City
corridor.

Figure 2

The formation of ground-level ozone requires
substantial automobile traffic emitting
nitrogen monoxide and VOCs, warmth, ample
sunlight, and relatively little movement of the
air mass.



452 Chapter 9

Ozone irritates the respiratory tract and eyes, and people with heart or lung
problems are at risk of lung damage. Ground-level ozone is also undesirable
because it damages plants, bleaches colour from fabrics, and hardens rubber,
thereby shortening the life span of tires.

Plants are damaged in several ways. According to current research, ozone
causes injury to foliage, increases susceptibility to diseases in plants and trees,
reduces yields in sensitive crops, and increases the mortality rates of individual
trees. As a result of ozone pollution from the American Midwest, certain crops,
such as white beans, can no longer be grown successfully in southwestern
Ontario. The maximum allowable ozone concentration in Canada is 82 ppb
averaged over a one-hour period, but this level is often exceeded in urban centres
(Figure 4). The federal and provincial governments have recently agreed to a
target of 65 ppb, averaged over an eight-hour period, by 2010.

In order to reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, it is necessary to
reduce the concentration of the reactants in the air. Since it is usually the con-
centration of NOx that controls the overall rate of the ozone-producing reac-
tions, most research has focused on developing technologies to reduce the
amounts of NOx released into the atmosphere. Catalytic converters significantly
reduce the level of NOx emitted by automobile engines. In a catalytic converter
the hot exhaust gases pass over a surface containing beads of rhodium, platinum,
and palladium, which reduces NO(g) to N2(g) and oxidizes CO(g) to CO2(g). The
air in Los Angeles used to reach ozone levels of 680 ppb but has been reduced to
around 300 ppb, thanks in large part to the development of catalytic converters.

Gas Mixtures and Reactions
Seen from space, our atmosphere does not look very impressive—only a thin
blue layer around the planet—yet it is essential to our existence (Figure 1). A
complex, variable mixture of gases, it is also the medium for a great variety of
both useful and harmful gas reactions. Many familiar gases in the atmosphere
have a dual personality: Oxygen gas is essential for us to breathe, but too little or
too much is deadly. Nitrogen is an important nutrient source for plants (and
indirectly for us), but its reactions with oxygen can produce dangerous sub-
stances such as those found in smog and acid rain. Carbon dioxide is necessary
for green plants to produce food and oxygen by photosynthesis, but too much
may have long-term, undesirable climate effects or can be suffocating (Figure 2).
Ozone is another good example of an atmospheric gas that is both useful and
dangerous. High in the atmosphere, a low-density ozone layer protects us from
harmful UV radiation, but in the lower atmosphere ozone is a very destructive
and lethal chemical.

These gases are only some of the constituents of the atmosphere. There are
many others that are formed by natural or technological processes. An under-
standing of the properties of gas mixtures and reactions is necessary to begin to
understand the complex atmosphere in which we live.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• describe the total pressure of a
gas mixture as the sum of the
partial pressures;

• state natural and technological
examples in which partial pres-
sure plays a role; 

• explain Dalton’s law of partial
pressures using the kinetic molec-
ular theory;

• use the law of combining vol-
umes to solve for reacting vol-
umes of gases;

• state Avogadro’s theory and
describe its importance in under-
standing gas reactions;

• define and use molar volumes at
STP and SATP to convert between
volumes and amounts of gases;

• determine, experimentally, the
molar volume of a gas;

• perform stoichiometric calcula-
tions for reactions involving
gases; 

• describe how knowledge of gases
relates to natural phenomena,
technological products, and other
areas of study.

The concentrations of the gases in our atmosphere change with time. Sometimes
these changes are local; sometimes they are global. Sometimes the concentrations
vary as a result of natural causes, such as a volcano, and sometimes they are due
to activities by humans, such as our production of car exhaust pollution.

1. How do the properties of gas mixtures, like the atmosphere, compare with
those of other homogeneous mixtures, such as aqueous solutions?

2. How is the study of the reactions of gases similar to and different from
other reactions you have studied?

3. What are some beneficial applications of gases and some problems associ-
ated with gases?

460 Chapter 10

10.1 Mixtures of Gases
In the 18th century, many scientists believed that the atmosphere was a single
chemical compound, not a mixture of gaseous elements and compounds as we
know today. In France in the 1770s, Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), acknowl-
edged as the father of modern chemistry, began a series of experiments involving
burning substances, for example, diamonds, in air (Figure 1). After numerous
quantitative experiments over several years, he concluded that air consisted of at
least two different gases: one that supported combustion and one that did not.
These experiments not only led to the discovery of the presence of oxygen in air,
but also established the law of conservation of mass for chemical reactions.

In some of his combustion experiments Lavoisier noticed that when various
metal oxides were formed from a heated metal and air sealed in a flask, room air
rushed into the flask when it was opened. This indicated a decrease in pressure
inside the flask because the room air, at a higher pressure, was immediately
forced into the flask. Gases naturally move from a higher-pressure to a lower-
pressure region. The reduction of the air pressure inside the flask clearly sup-
ported his idea that part of the air (the oxygen) was reacted and therefore
removed. There is no indication that Lavoisier himself measured any changes in
pressure. However, his experimental designs and methods for careful quantita-
tive observations were continued by many chemists and much was learned about
chemical compounds, the composition of air, and the properties of gases.

Of particular note on the properties of gases is the work by John Dalton
(1766–1844). In the early 1800s, Dalton hypothesized that gas particles behaved
independently and that the pressure exerted by a particular gas is the same
whether it exists by itself or in a gas mixture (if we assume the same tempera-
ture). Dalton proceeded to test this hypothesis by conducting a series of experi-
ments to determine the pressure that each component of air contributes to the
total air pressure (Table 1). The pressure of an individual gas in a gas mixture
can be thought of like the concentration of a solute in a solution. For example, a
household vinegar solution contains 5% acetic acid; the remaining 95% is water.
The partial pressure of oxygen in air can be thought of as a concentration, or
fraction, of air. Notice that the pressure (in kilopascals) of each component in air
(Table 1) is very close to its actual percentage composition. This is largely a con-
sequence of the unit of measure—normal air pressure in SI units is about
100 kPa. If other units of pressure, such as millimetres of mercury, are used, this
direct similarity does not exist. However, the fraction is still the same no matter
what pressure units are used.

Dalton also determined that the water vapour pressure was quite variable
and depended on the temperature of the air. Furthermore, the pressure of water
vapour is the same whether by itself (with no other gases present) or in a gas
mixture such as air.

Dalton’s hypothesis was verified by his extensive experiments as well as those
of other chemists and is now known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures: The
total pressure of a mixture of nonreacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial
pressures of the individual gases (Figure 2). In symbols, this law is represented as

ptotal � p1 � p2 � p3 � …

Any pressure unit may be used with this definition as long as the same unit is
used for all partial pressures and the total pressure of the mixture.

Explaining Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures

The kinetic molecular theory is a cornerstone of modern science. While useful
for studying all states of matter, it was initially developed to explain the proper-
ties of gases. According to this theory, gases consist of a very large number of
atoms and/or molecules that are constantly moving and colliding with each
other and the walls of the container. Gas particles are believed to move in straight
lines between collisions, which means that the molecules do not attract or repel
each other. If we assume a nonreacting mixture, the gas particles in a mixture
behave like any other collection of gas molecules. It makes no difference if a con-
tainer holds only one kind of molecule or several kinds of gas molecules
(Figure 3).

In both cylinders, the frequency of the colli-
sions of particles with the walls of the con-
tainer is the same. The collisions may involve
only one kind of gas molecule or several
kinds of gas molecules.

Laws and Theories

Laws tend to precede theories. For example,
the gas laws you are studying in this unit
were all solidly established before the kinetic
molecular theory was created to explain
them. Theories explain laws in terms of
unobservables, such as molecules and inter-
molecular forces. Laws are based on observ-
ables (measurements).

Gas Mixtures and Reactions 463

10.1

Dalton’s law of partial pressures can be explained by two concepts from the
kinetic molecular theory:

• The pressure of a gas is caused by the collisions of molecules with the walls
of the container.

• Gas molecules act independently of each other.

Therefore, the total pressure (total of the collisions with the walls) is the sum of the
individual pressures (collisions of only one kind of particle) of each gas present.

Applications of Partial Pressure

Gas exchange between living organisms and the environment depends on the
properties of gases, in particular, partial pressure and solubility. Respiration is one
of the most important processes because we need to breathe in oxygen and breathe
out carbon dioxide in order to live. Results from human respiration studies at
normal atmospheric pressure clearly show the changes in partial pressures of these
two gases (Table 2). Notice from Table 2 that the air we exhale contains less oxygen
and considerably more carbon dioxide compared with the inhaled air. Because the
total pressure of both inhaled and exhaled air must be the same as atmospheric
pressure, the partial pressure of a component such as oxygen represents its fraction
of the total pressure. In other words, inhaled air contains about 21% oxygen, but
exhaled air contains only about 15% oxygen. The difference is what has been
absorbed by blood in the capillaries surrounding the lungs of a person.

Absorbing Oxygen

You may have about 3.5 × 108 tiny alveoli (air
sacs) in each lung. The surface area of con-
tact with capillaries for absorbing oxygen is
about 75 m2, about four times as much area
as an average classroom floor!

DID YOU KNOW ?



464 Chapter 10

Oxygen is the most important gas in the atmosphere; it makes up approxi-
mately 21% of the volume of dry air. Partial pressure of a gas is more useful than
a percentage composition because it is the pressure (force per unit area) of oxygen
that determines how much oxygen is absorbed by the lungs of a person. The
Biosphere project in Arizona (Figure 4) came to an abrupt end because the people
sealed inside the dome were not able to breathe very well when the oxygen levels
dropped to about 17 kPa (17% at normal atmospheric pressure). At the top of a
high mountain the percentage oxygen may still be a normal 21%, but the partial
pressure of oxygen may be sufficiently low that the human system cannot func-
tion very well. For example, 21% of 101 kPa (one atmosphere) is about 21 kPa for
the partial pressure of oxygen, pO

2
, but 21% of 33 kPa (at the top of Mount

Everest) is only about 7 kPa for pO
2
. Most people, the exceptions being extremely

fit people adapted to high altitudes, require about 10 kPa in order to survive.
Another application of partial pressures that you will encounter in chemistry

is the collection of gases by the displacement of water. Hydrogen and oxygen
gases are often generated in the laboratory and collected by bubbling the gases
into a container filled with water (Figure 5). Both of these gases have a relatively
low solubility in water. However, water evaporates relatively easily and the gas
collected will be mixed with some water vapour. Water vapour is a gas like any
other gas and the pressure exerted by a gas above its liquid is called its vapour
pressure. The vapour pressure of water at different temperatures is well known
(Table 3). Dalton’s law of partial pressures and a table of known vapour pressures
of water can be used to determine the pressure of dry gas that has been collected.

Sample Problem 2

In a laboratory, oxygen gas was collected by water displacement at an atmos-
pheric pressure of 96.8 kPa and a temperature of 22°C. Using Table 3, calculate
the partial pressure of dry oxygen.

10.2 Reactions of Gases
In 1809, Joseph Gay-Lussac, a French scientist and a colleague of Jacques Charles,
measured the relative volumes of gases involved in chemical reactions. For
example, when he combined hydrogen and chlorine gases at the same tempera-
ture and pressure, he noticed that every one litre of hydrogen gas, H2(g), reacted
with one litre of chlorine gas, Cl2(g), to produce two litres of hydrogen chloride
gas, HCl(g).

hydrogen � chlorine → hydrogen chloride
1.0 L 1.0 L 2.0 L

ratio 1 1 2

His observations of several gas reactions led to the law of combining volumes,
which states that when measured at the same temperature and pressure, volumes of
gaseous reactants and products of chemical reactions are always in simple ratios of
whole numbers. This law is also known as Gay-Lussac’s law of combining vol-
umes. Not all reactants and products need be gases, but the law deals only with
the gases consumed or produced. An example of this is the simple decomposi-
tion of liquid water, in which the volumes of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas pro-
duced are always in the ratio of 2:1 (Figure 1).

Two years after this law was formulated, Amedeo Avogadro proposed an
explanation which, unfortunately, was largely ignored for about half a century.
Avogadro initially got his idea from the simple relationship between volume and
temperature (Charles’s law, Chapter 9) but did not follow up on it. When
Gay-Lussac published his work about combining volumes, Avogadro was
intrigued by the fact that reacting volumes of gases were in whole-number ratios,
just like the coefficients in a balanced equation. (Remember that this was only
about eight years after Dalton had presented his atomic theory of matter.)
Suggesting an explanation for the relationship between the volume ratios and
coefficient ratios, he proposed that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature
and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules, a statement that is best called
Avogadro’s theory. Avogadro’s initial idea was a hypothesis. Although it is still
sometimes referred to as a hypothesis, the idea is firmly established. Therefore,
Avogadro’s idea has the status of a theory.

This theoretical concept explains the law of combining volumes. For
example, if a reaction occurs between two volumes of one gas and one volume of
another at the same temperature and pressure, the theory says that two mole-
cules of the first substance react with one molecule of the second. Another
example is the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, in which ammonia is pro-
duced (Figure 2).

When all gases are at the same temperature and pressure, the law of com-
bining gas volumes provides an efficient way of predicting the volumes of gases

as power plants. Suggest some reasons why the average total
pressure of the atmosphere has not been steadily increasing.

ratios provided by the balanced equation are also the volume ratios. For example,

temperature and pressure contain an equal number of particles. The mole con-
cept indicates that a mole is a specific number of particles—Avogadro’s number
of particles. Therefore, for all gases at each specific pressure and temperature,
there must be a certain volume that contains one mole of particles. Logically, this
molar volume is the same for all gases at the same temperature and pressure.
(This is not true for liquids and solids.) For scientific work, the most useful spe-
cific pressure and temperature conditions are either SATP or STP. It has been
determined empirically that the molar volume of a gas at SATP is 24.8 L/mol.
The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol (Figure 4).

Knowing the molar volume of gases allows scientists to work with easily
measured volumes of gases when specific amounts of gases are needed.
Measuring the volume of a gas is much more convenient than measuring its
mass. Imagine trapping a gas in a container and trying to measure its mass on a
balance—and then making corrections for the buoyant force of the surrounding
air. Also, working with gas volumes is more precise because the process involves
measuring relatively large volumes rather than relatively small masses. Molar
volume can be used as a conversion factor to convert amount in moles to
volume, as shown in the following example.

In SI symbols, the relationship of amount (n), volume (v), and molar
volume (V) is expressed as

n � �
V

v
� or  v � nV

Sample Problem 2

What volume is occupied by 0.024 mol of carbon dioxide gas at SATP?

Solution

nCO2
� 0.024 mol

VSATP � 24.8 L/mol

molar volume: The volume that one
mole, in this case a gas, occupies at a speci-
fied temperature and pressure.

Figure 4

At STP, one mole of gas has a volume of
22.4 L, which is approximately the volume of
11 “empty” 2-L pop bottles.

Real Molar Volumes

When performing calculations, we will
assume in this text that real gases behave
like ideal gases. You can make your own
judgment on just how valid this assumption
is by considering the empirical values for
molar volumes of selected gases.

Notice how the units cancel in the example above. A molar volume can also be
used to convert from a volume to an amount in moles. In this case, the molar
volume ratio must be inverted to allow for the correct cancellation of units.

Gases such as oxygen and nitrogen are often liquefied for storage and trans-
portation, then allowed to vaporize for use in a technological application.
Helium is stored and transported as a compressed gas. Both liquefied and com-
pressed gases are sold by mass. Molar volume and molar mass can be combined
to calculate the volume of gas that is available from a known mass of a substance.

For example, helium-filled balloons (Figure 5), often used for party decora-
tions, are less dense than air, so they stay aloft and will rise unless tied down by
a string. What volume does 3.50 g of helium gas occupy at SATP? To answer this
question, we first need to convert the mass into an amount in moles:

nHe � 3.50 g� ×

nHe � 0.875 mol

10.3 The Ozone Layer
As you learned in Chapter 9, ground-level ozone is the main harmful ingredient
in smog. However, ozone in the stratosphere (10–50 km above Earth’s surface) is
beneficial because it protects us and the environment by preventing most of the
short-wavelength, high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation from reaching Earth’s
surface (Figure 1, page 476). If all of the UV radiation in sunlight were to reach
Earth’s surface, serious damage would occur to life on Earth. The higher-energy
UV radiation has enough energy to break covalent bonds; the resulting chemical
changes cause sunburn and are linked to the development of cataracts and skin
cancer. It can also induce genetic mutations and destroy vegetation. Canada has
been active in ozone research since the 1930s and has operated the World Ozone
Atmospheric Data Centre since the 1950s. Monitoring ozone levels began in
Canada in the late 1950s. In addition to atmospheric studies, Canadian scientists
have conducted extensive studies of the impact of increased UV radiation on
important species in agriculture and forestry, and on freshwater and marine
organisms.

476 Chapter 10

Ultraviolet radiation is involved in producing the ozone layer, as shown in
the following reactions:

UV
O2(g) → O(g) � O(g)
O(g) � O2(g) → O3(g)

Molecular oxygen in the upper atmosphere absorbs only the higher-energy UV
light, and by absorbing this, splits into two oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms are
extremely reactive, and most of them react with an oxygen molecule to form
ozone. This reaction is exothermic, that is, releases heat, and is believed to be
responsible for the higher temperatures in the stratosphere compared to the
atmospheric levels immediately above and below it. Ozone molecules also absorb
certain parts of UV light and decompose back to oxygen molecules and oxygen
atoms. Through the processes of formation and decomposition of ozone, almost
all of the harmful UV light is absorbed. The ozone layer in the stratosphere actu-
ally contains very little ozone, rarely exceeding 10 ppm in concentration. If all of
the ozone were to be collected at ground level at SATP, the layer would only be
about 0.3 mm thick.

For the past 30 years, scientists have been concerned about the effect of cer-
tain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone reaction. The CFCs, which are
generally known by their trade name, Freon, were first synthesized in the 1930s.
Some of the common ones are CFCl3(g) (Freon-11), CF2Cl2(g) (Freon-12),
C2F3Cl3(g) (Freon-113), and C2F4Cl2(g) (Freon-114). Because these compounds
are readily liquefied, relatively inert, nontoxic, noncombustible, and volatile, they
have been used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. Large quantities

of CFCs were also used in the manufacture of disposable foam products, such as
cups and plates, and as aerosol propellants in spray cans. Most of the CFCs pro-
duced for commercial and industrial use are eventually released to the atmos-
phere. Because they are relatively inert, CFCs remain unchanged in the
atmosphere and eventually diffuse to the stratosphere, where UV radiation
causes them to decompose. Scientific theory and evidence indicate that, once
emitted to the atmosphere, these compounds significantly deplete the ozone
layer that shields the planet from damaging UV radiation. For example, the fol-
lowing equations show the reactions started by a molecule of Freon-11:

UV
CFCl3(g) → CFCl2(g) � Cl(g) 

The reactive chlorine atoms undergo the following reactions:

Cl�(g) � O3(g) → ClO�(g) � O2(g)

ClO�(g) � O(g) → Cl�(g) � O2(g)

Looking at the net reaction by cancelling the particles that are the same on both
sides of the reaction equations, you can see that the net reaction is the conversion
of ozone to oxygen molecules:

O3(g) � O(g) → 2 O2(g)

Note that the chlorine atom plays the role of a catalyst, since it is not used up and
can, therefore, take part in many such reactions. Research has shown that a single
chlorine atom can cause the destruction of thousands of ozone molecules.

Scientists have been measuring Antarctic ozone levels since the early 1970s.
The first “hole” in the ozone layer was discovered in 1985. “Holes” in the ozone
layer are more accurately referred to as areas of ozone thinning, because they are
much like the worn-out places in an old sweater where there are still threads cov-
ering the worn-out area but the fabric is so thin you can see right through it. In
September 2000, scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) detected the largest-ever area of ozone thinning over Antarctica. The
area spanned 28.3 million square kilometres, nearly three times the size of
Canada. Ozone thinning has also been found in the stratosphere over the Arctic
regions of Canada (Figure 2).

Why is ozone thinning occurring only over the polar regions, and particu-
larly Antarctica? According to current theory and evidence, the long, extremely
cold polar winter results in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. During
the dark winter, the particles in these clouds tie up water and nitrogen com-
pounds and promote reactions at the particles’ surface, which release chlorine. In
early spring, the returning sunlight triggers the photochemical reaction catalyzed
by the free chlorine. The freezing and chemical reactions in the clouds take time
and very low temperatures. In the Arctic, the temperatures are not as low and the
air is not as stable as in the Antarctic. Therefore, ozone thinning is not as exten-
sive  in Canada’s North.

Significant ozone depletion over Antarctica has effects well beyond this iso-
lated region. The hole itself contributes to a general dilution of ozone concen-
tration, because winds in the spring move large quantities of air very low in
ozone out of the polar regions and into the general circulation in the hemi-
spheres. Evidence from satellite measurements shows a general, continuous
decline in ozone levels across the globe. A thinned-out ozone layer could result

in more skin cancers and cataracts. Scientists are looking into possible harm to
agriculture, since there is some evidence of damage to plant life in Antarctic seas.
Research and ozone data gathering continue. Canada continues its contribution
through its Arctic Observatory and the development of sophisticated ozone-
measuring instruments. In addition, the National Research Council is actively
engaged in researching and developing alternatives to CFCs.

The Montreal Protocol

In the late 1970s, the use of CFCs in spray cans in North America and Europe was
declining mainly by voluntary agreements. However, other uses of CFCs con-
tinued to grow. There were several attempts by the United Nations Environment
Program to call on governments to reduce all uses of CFCs but most govern-
ments ignored the plea. In the early 1980s, Canada, along with a few other coun-
tries, began pressing for a ban on all spray-can uses. After much political debate
and accusations among countries, a convention was held in Geneva that laid the
groundwork for the final round of meetings in Montreal. The Montreal Protocol
on substances that deplete the ozone layer is a landmark international agreement
designed to protect the ozone layer. The treaty was signed by 27 countries in
1987, now expanded to 175 countries. The agreement was substantially amended
in 1990, 1992, and, more recently, in January 2001. The original Montreal
Protocol stipulated that the production and consumption of compounds that
deplete ozone in the stratosphere were to be phased out by 2000. Table 1 lists
these compounds and their uses.

Scientists estimate that the current use of the ozone-destroying substances
(ODSs) listed in Table 1 is about 40% of what it was when the Montreal Protocol
was signed—well short of the complete phase-out intended by 2000. Even when
production of these chemicals stops, it will be some time before the ozone layer
is repaired. With the ozone-destroying chemicals that are already in the strato-
sphere and those that will arrive within the next few years, ozone destruction will
likely continue for another 50 years.

Most of the countries that signed the Montreal Protocol also developed
national policies to maximize recycling, ban nonessential uses, develop labelling
requirements, and examine safe alternatives for ODSs. In Canada, the production
and import of CFCs have been reduced by 85%. The provinces have developed
regulations for recycling Freon-12, widely used in refrigerators and automobile
air conditioners. Canada has done a good job in controlling ODSs and helping
developing countries meet the commitments to the Protocol. However, some

environmental groups think that Canada could do much more to completely
eliminate, rather than control, ODSs and prohibit questionable replacements for
CFCs.

Unfortunately, most of the CFCs in equipment before the Montreal Protocol
still exist, and there is no plan to dispose of them. According to the Sierra Club
of Canada, about 130 Mt of CFCs are still in use in Canada, and 40% of these are
in our homes and automobiles. What are the alternatives? Some industries, such
as the automobile manufacturers, have switched to hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs) or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in their air-conditioning units.
Although they may claim to be “ozone friendly,” because HCFCs and HFCs have
less impact on the ozone layer, this is only an interim solution. Both are potent
greenhouse gases, so we are partially solving one problem only to create another
potential environmental problem.

A promising alternative for many CFC uses is hydrofluoroether
(C4F9OCH3(l)), also known as HFE. Research indicates that this substance has no
effect on ozone, is not a greenhouse gas, and is nontoxic. Another alternative is
the use of hydrocarbons such as propane, pentane, isobutane, and cyclopentane
in refrigerators (Figure 3) and foam containers and insulation. Carefully chosen
hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion potential and little impact as green-
house gases. They are also very efficient refrigerants and widely available.
Unfortunately for the chemical industry giants such as DuPont and ICI, these
hydrocarbons cannot be licensed like CFCs and the related compounds in which
they have invested billions of dollars. It is therefore not surprising that hydro-
carbon-based refrigerators are widely available on all continents except North
America. Are the Canadian and U.S. governments protecting the large chemical
industries who have a vested interest in CFC-related compounds?

Earth’s surface? Describe briefly how this happens.

stances because they undergo reactions similar to the sequence
shown earlier for Freon-11, with a bromine atom taking the place of a
chlorine atom. Write the reaction sequence initiated by UV radiation
splitting a bromine atom from a molecule of CF3Br.

Antarctic?

7. What implications does the thinning of the ozone layer have for
people who like to suntan?

technological applications and scientific studies of gases, it is necessary to accu-
rately calculate quantities of gaseous reactants and products.

The method of stoichiometry applies to all chemical reactions. This section
extends stoichiometry to gases, using gas volume, molar volume, and the ideal
gas law. For example, if 275 g of propane burns in a gas barbecue, what volume
of oxygen measured at STP is required for the reaction? To answer this question,
write a balanced chemical equation to relate the amount propane to the amount
oxygen. List the given and the required measurements and the conversion factors
for each chemical, just as you did in the previous stoichiometry questions:

C3H8(g) � 5 O2(g) → 3 CO2(g) � 4 H2O(g)
275 g v

44.11 g/mol 22.4 L/mol

Since propane and oxygen are related by their mole ratio, you must convert the
mass of propane to an amount in moles:

The balanced equation indicates that one mole of propane reacts with five moles
of oxygen. Use this mole ratio to calculate the amount of oxygen required, in
moles. (This step is common to all stoichiometry calculations.)

Note that the general steps of the stoichiometry calculation are the same for
both solids and gases. Changes from mass to amount or from volume to amount,
or vice versa, are done using the molar mass or the molar volume, respectively,
of the substance. Although the molar mass depends on the chemical involved, the
molar volume of a gas depends only on temperature and pressure. If the condi-
tions are not standard (i.e., STP or SATP), then the ideal gas law (pv � nRT),
rather than the molar volume, is used to find the amount or volume of a gas, as
in the following example.

Procedure

1. Measure and record the mass of the strip of magnesium.

2. Fold the magnesium ribbon to make a small compact bundle that can be
held by a copper cage (Figure 2).

3. Wrap the fine copper wire all around the magnesium, making a cage to
hold it but leaving 30 mm to 50 mm of the wire free for a handle.

4. Carefully pour 10 mL to 15 mL of the hydrochloric acid into the graduated
cylinder.

5. Slowly fill the graduated cylinder to the brim with water from a beaker. As
you fill the cylinder, pour slowly down the side of the cylinder to minimize
mixing of the water with the acid at the bottom. In this way, the liquid at
the top of the cylinder is relatively pure water and the acid remains at the
bottom.

6. Half-fill the large beaker with water.

7. Bend the copper wire handle through the holes in the stopper so that the
cage holding the magnesium is positioned about 10 mm below the bottom
of the stopper (Figure 2).

8. Insert the stopper into the graduated cylinder; the liquid in the cylinder
will overflow a little. Cover the holes in the stopper with your finger.
Working quickly, invert the cylinder, and immediately lower it into the
large beaker so that the stopper is below the surface of the water before you
remove your finger from the stopper holes (Figure 3 page 486).

9. Observe the reaction, then wait about 5 min after the bubbling stops to
allow the contents of the graduated cylinder to reach room temperature.

10. Raise or lower the graduated cylinder so that the level of liquid inside the
beaker is the same as the level of liquid in the graduated cylinder. (This
equalizes the gas pressure in the cylinder with the pressure of the air in the
room.)

11. Measure and record the volume of gas in the graduated cylinder.

12. Record the laboratory (ambient) temperature and pressure.

13. The liquids in this investigation may be poured down the sink, but rinse
the sink with lots of water.

Eye protection, a lab apron,
and disposable gloves must
be worn.

Hydrochloric acid in
6 mol/L concentration is very
corrosive. If acid is splashed
into your eyes, rinse them
immediately with water for
15 to 20 min. Acid splashed
onto the skin should be
rinsed immediately with
plenty of water. If acid is
splashed onto your clothes,
neutralize with baking soda,
then wash thoroughly with
plenty of water. Notify your
teacher.

Rinse your hands well
after step 7 in case you got
any dilute acid on your skin.

Hydrogen gas, produced in
the reaction of hydrochloric
acid and magnesium, is

is adequate ventilation and
that there are no open

sulfuric acid. Predict the volume of hydrogen gas at STP pro-

2. A typical Canadian home heated with natural gas (assume
methane, CH4(g)) consumes 2.00 ML of natural gas during the
month of December. What volume of oxygen at SATP is required
to burn 2.00 ML of methane measured at 0°C and 120 kPa?

3. Ammonia reacts with sulfuric acid to form the important fertilizer
ammonium sulfate. What mass of ammonium sulfate can be pro-
duced from 75.0 kL of ammonia at 10°C and 110 kPa?

4. Methane hydrate, a possible energy resource, looks like ice but is
an unusual substance with the approximate chemical formula
CH4•6H2O(s). It occurs in permafrost regions and in large quanti-
ties on the ocean floor. Current, rough estimates of the quantity
of methane hydrate suggest that it is at least twice the total
known reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas combined.
Considerable research is now under way to find ways to tap this
huge energy resource. If 1.0 kg of solid methane hydrate decom-
poses to methane gas and water, what volume of methane is pro-
duced at 20°C and 95 kPa?

10.5 Applications of Gases
Many people have some direct experience with and practical knowledge about
gases. We may be familiar with pressure in car tires and why this should be
adjusted as the seasons change. Some of us use aerosol cans containing pressur-
ized gases and have flown in pressurized cabins on airplanes. Some people with
joint problems claim that they can tell when a weather system is moving in
because the air pressure starts to change and they “feel it in their bones.” Ideally,
none of us will experience an inflated air bag as a result of an automobile colli-
sion. All of these examples involve gases and their properties. A more detailed
and scientific understanding of gases is required in a wide variety of areas, such
as meteorology, medicine, and deep-sea diving.

Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and weather forecasting. You
have probably seen weather reports citing high- and low-pressure systems
(Figure 1, page 488). However, this is only one aspect of how gas properties are
important in meteorology. The atmosphere is a complex, variable mixture of
gases. The composition and partial pressures of these gases determine the den-
sity of an air mass, which is an important characteristic for understanding and
predicting weather. There are many other variables such as Earth’s tilt and the
variations in the heating of Earth’s surface that make describing the empirical
properties of the atmosphere, explaining these properties, and then predicting
changes in weather extremely complicated. Meteorologists use sophisticated
computer models to simulate weather changes based on vast quantities of data
collected around the world. These models rely, in part, on data gathered by
helium weather balloons. Some weather balloons may go as high as 30 km, where
the air pressure is 1.2 kPa and the air temperature is –47°C, so designing them
requires not only knowledge of gas properties but also knowledge of properties
of the materials used to make them.

In the area of medicine, most gas applications are in artificial ventilation and
the use of anaesthetics. Ventilation (breathing) is the process by which oxygen and
carbon dioxide are transported to and from the lungs. Breathing is something we
do naturally, without thinking, but occasionally the respiratory system can fail
and we need help, sometimes immediately. This could be provided by another
person who applies artificial respiration, a portable source of oxygen, or best, by
a ventilator that controls both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Artificial ventilation
becomes particularly important when anaesthetics are used to make a person
unconscious during surgery. Many drugs and techniques used in anaesthesia

properties of the atmosphere, explaining these properties, and then predicting
changes in weather extremely complicated. Meteorologists use sophisticated
computer models to simulate weather changes based on vast quantities of data
collected around the world. These models rely, in part, on data gathered by
helium weather balloons. Some weather balloons may go as high as 30 km, where
the air pressure is 1.2 kPa and the air temperature is –47°C, so designing them
requires not only knowledge of gas properties but also knowledge of properties
of the materials used to make them.

In the area of medicine, most gas applications are in artificial ventilation and
the use of anaesthetics. Ventilation (breathing) is the process by which oxygen and
carbon dioxide are transported to and from the lungs. Breathing is something we
do naturally, without thinking, but occasionally the respiratory system can fail
and we need help, sometimes immediately. This could be provided by another
person who applies artificial respiration, a portable source of oxygen, or best, by
a ventilator that controls both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Artificial ventilation
becomes particularly important when anaesthetics are used to make a person
unconscious during surgery. Many drugs and techniques used in anaesthesia

interfere with our natural ventilation. An anaesthetic machine, such as Boyle’s
machine (Figure 2), controls not only the ventilation of the patient but also the
administration of gaseous anaesthetics like dinitrogen oxide (nitrous oxide) or
volatile liquid anaesthetics. As you can see in Figure 2, gas cylinders, pressure
gauges, and flow meters are important components of the apparatus. To work in
any area of medicine as a medical doctor, nurse, or technician dealing with respi-
ration requires a good understanding of gas laws and lung mechanics.

Understanding Concepts

1. A helium balloon with a volume of 4.0 kL, a pressure of 100 kPa, and
temperature of 20°C is released to study ozone concentrations in the
stratosphere. What would be its volume when it is 30 km above
Earth’s surface? (Assume the balloon expands and contracts without
resistance.)

2. Humidity is an important property of an air mass. Is an air mass with
a high humidity (i.e., high partial pressure of water vapour) denser or
less dense than a very dry air mass at the same volume, tempera-
ture, and pressure? Justify your answer, using your knowledge of gas
laws, molar masses, and density.

3. Dinitrogen oxide (nitrous oxide) is a colourless, sweet-tasting gas
first discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1793. It is commonly known as
“laughing gas” and for almost 50 years it was used solely for recre-
ational enjoyment and public shows or carnivals. Its use as an anaes-
thetic for dentistry and medicine began in the early 1840s and
continues today (Figure 2).

Hydrocarbons
Organic chemicals include most chemicals that compose living material—both
plants and animals. All carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (lipids) are organic
compounds. Pesticides and antibiotics are organic compounds. DNA, RNA,
chromosomes, and genes are composed of organic compounds. Fossil fuels,
lubricants, and gasoline are organic. Polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, and
polyester are organic polymers. In this unit you will study hydrocarbons, a class
of organic chemicals made up of only carbon and hydrogen atoms.

Hydrocarbons serve a dual purpose in society: They are fuels that may be
used to produce electricity, run automobiles, and cook meals; and they are used
to produce petrochemicals and thus may be the source of almost anything man-
ufactured, including furniture, processed foods, computers, stereos, plastics, syn-
thetic fabrics, cosmetics, synthetic sweeteners, soaps, solvents, and refrigerants.
The list grows longer and longer each year.

This dual purpose of hydrocarbons is integrated into the carbon cycle, as
illustrated in Figure 1. Knowledge of the chemistry of hydrocarbons will help
you make increasingly important decisions about our society and our planet.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• describe the origins and major
sources of organic compounds,
particularly hydrocarbons;

• describe and explain the charac-
teristics of different structures of
hydrocarbons, using Lewis
bonding theory;

• describe the process of petroleum
refining and the uses society has
for the products of this process;

• describe and determine by experi-
mentation some physical and
chemical properties of single-,
double-, and triple-bonded hydro-
carbon compounds;

• name and draw structural for-
mulas for a wide variety of hydro-
carbon compounds;

• represent a wide variety of hydro-
carbon compounds by using
molecular models to show their
atom arrangement;

• describe science- and technology-
based careers in the petrochem-
ical industry; 

• discuss the risks and benefits of
society’s dependence on petro-
chemicals, particularly hydrocar-
bons.

The hydrocarbon butane, C4H10(g), is used in a wide variety of small per-
sonal devices, such as lighters. Butane is a gas at SATP, but liquefies
under only moderate pressure, a property that makes it a very convenient
fuel. 

Materials: a small (sandwich-size) resealable plastic bag, a butane cylinder
(for refilling butane lighters), a 250-mL beaker, eye protection, matches

• Hold the cylinder with the nozzle end down, inside the open plastic
bag, and pull the nozzle back so that a small amount (approximately
1–2 mL) of liquid butane sprays into the bag. 

• Seal the plastic bag and hold it so that the liquid butane inside is
warmed by your hand. Don’t overdo this and freeze your skin;
boiling butane is very cold. 

• Observe the physical properties (volume, temperature, colour) of
butane as it changes physical state. Then open the bag upside down

506 Chapter 11

11.1 Organic Compounds
In the early 19th century, Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848)
classified compounds into two primary categories: those obtained from living
organisms, which he called organic, and those obtained from mineral sources,
which he called inorganic. At that time, most chemists believed that organic
chemicals could be synthesized only in living systems. A theory called “vitalism”
proposed that the laws of nature were somehow different for living and nonliving
systems and that the synthesis of organic compounds necessarily involved a “vital
force,” present only in living organisms.

This theory was shown to be unacceptable in 1828 by German chemist
Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882). Wöhler performed a revolutionary laboratory
experiment in which he used the inorganic compound ammonium cyanate,
NH4OCN(s), to synthesize urea, H2NCONH2(s), a well-known organic com-
pound that is produced by many living organisms. In the years following
Wöhler’s experiment, chemists synthesized many other organic compounds. For
example, acetic acid (ethanoic acid), HC2H3O2(l), a relatively simple molecule,
was synthesized in 1845 in Germany by Adolph Kolbe (1818–1884). Sucrose,
C12H22O11(s), (Figure 1), has a more complex structure and was long thought
impossible to create in a laboratory—until 1953, when it was first synthesized by
Canadian chemist Raymond Lemieux (1920–2001).

Today, organic compounds are defined as compounds that contain carbon,
and organic chemistry is defined as the study of organic compounds. This can
seem like a limitless task, since more than nine million such compounds have
been identified. We simplify our organization by grouping organic compounds
according to their properties and molecular structures, which, we explain, are a
result of the structure of the covalent bonds within organic molecules. By
common convention, the two oxides of carbon, CO2(g) and CO(g), are not nor-
mally considered to be organic compounds. Compounds of carbonate, bicar-
bonate, cyanide, cyanate, and thiocyanate ions all contain carbon atoms, but
these are also not considered to be organic compounds because their properties
are explained by ionic bonds.

Figure 1

Sucrose (table sugar, C12H22O11(s)) occurs nat-
urally in plants and in fairly high concentra-
tions in sugar beets and sugar cane (shown
here). No sugar cane is grown in Canada,
although it is refined in New Brunswick,
Quebec, and Ontario. Sugar beets are grown
and refined in Quebec, Manitoba, and
Alberta. High-fructose (fruit sugar, C6H12O6(s))
corn syrup is refined in Ontario.

Hydrocarbons 507

The simplest way to begin a detailed study of organic compounds is with
hydrocarbons, those compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
Based on previous generalizations (Unit 1), hydrocarbons are all nonpolar sub-
stances. Therefore, they all have a low solubility in water, and their physical prop-
erties—such as states, densities, and melting and boiling points—form clear
trends largely explained by London (dispersion) forces. We consider all organic
compounds to be derivatives of hydrocarbons for classification purposes; that is,
we classify all organic compounds as though they were hydrocarbons that were
then changed by atom rearrangement, addition, and substitution into their
present chemical structure. Because we use this system, understanding hydro-
carbons is essential for the study of any area within the field of organic chemistry.

Sources and Uses

Coal, crude oil, oil sands, heavy oil, and natural gas are the nonrenewable sources
of fuels that power our society. All of these substances are formed over millions
of years from plant and animal material that, over geologic time periods, is sub-
jected to heat and pressure. The original compounds gradually convert to a very
complex mix of organic compounds we generally name according to the physical
state of the mixture, for example, sand, oil, and gas. We call all of these com-
pound mixtures “fossil” fuels because of the way they are formed. These fuels are
primarily hydrocarbons. Over 95% of our society’s hydrocarbon use is for com-
bustion reactions to provide heat and electrical energy (primary uses).
Hydrocarbons are also the starting materials in the industrial chemical synthesis
of thousands of products such as fuels, plastics, solvents, medicines, and syn-
thetic fibres (secondary uses). Some hydrocarbons are obtained directly by phys-
ical separation from petroleum and natural gas, whereas others come from oil
and gas refining (Figure 2).

Refining is the technology that includes separating complex mixtures into
simpler purified components. The refining of coal and natural gas involves phys-
ical as well as chemical processes; for example, coal may be crushed and treated
with solvents. Components of natural gas are separated either by selectively 
dissolving them in chosen solvents or by condensation and distillation.
Petroleum refining, that is, refining crude oil, is much more complex than coal
or gas refining, but many more products are obtained from crude oil.

Sources of hydrocarbons other than fossil fuels are all living things, and, of
course, we believe fossil fuels were living things very long ago. Plant crops and
animal decomposition products can be used to produce hydrocarbons and other
organic compounds. For example, in old landfill waste disposal sites, methane,
CH4(g), is produced underground by bacterial decomposition of organic waste
material. Many cities tap into these sites to capture the gas, which can then be
burned as fuel in power-generating plants.

Classification of Hydrocarbons

The molecular structures of hydrocarbons determine how they are classified
(Figure 3). Organic compounds with molecular structures that are straight or
branched chains or rings of carbon-to-carbon bonds are called aliphatic com-
pounds. As you can see in Figure 3, this subgroup of hydrocarbons is further
classified into alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. The main purpose of this chapter is
to study the properties, molecular structure, and naming of these three groups of
aliphatic hydrocarbons, including both open-chain and ring compounds.
Hydrocarbons are either aliphatic or aromatic; aromatic compounds are organic
compounds that contain a benzene-like ring structure (Figure 4). For now, the
only aromatic compound that you need to know about is benzene, C6H6(l). You
may study aromatic hydrocarbons and the hydrocarbon derivatives in future
chemistry courses.

11.1

Simple Alkanes

Aliphatic hydrocarbons with molecules containing only single carbon-to-carbon
bonds with an open-chain (noncyclic) structure are called alkanes. The classifi-
cation system in Figure 3 shows where the study of alkanes fits into the big pic-
ture of organic compounds. The simplest member of the alkane series is
methane, CH4(g), which is the main constituent of natural gas used for home
heating. Other simple alkanes containing up to 10 carbon atoms in a continuous
chain are listed in Table 1. Each molecular formula in the series has one more
CH2 group than the one before it. Such a series of compounds, where each dif-
fers from the one before it by the same increment (CH2 in this case), is called a
homologous series. Comparing the formulas, you can see that the general for-
mula for these alkanes is always CnH2n+2; that is, they are a series of CH2 units
plus two terminal hydrogen atoms.

The empirical formulas for the alkanes, such as the ones listed in Table 1, can
be determined by combustion analysis and mass spectrometry. Empirically
determined chemical formulas are useful for communicating the numbers of
atoms present in a molecule. For simple molecules, the structure is often evident.
As the number of atoms in a molecule increases, the molecular formula must be
expanded in order to communicate the structure. One simple alternative is to
cluster groups of atoms, for example, writing CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3 to represent
the way in which the atoms bond in C5H12 molecules.

The expanded molecular formula, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3, is one alternative
to the usual molecular formula for pentane, C5H12(l). Chemists have created
other ways to communicate the structures of these compounds. People are very
visual beings and often find models to be an effective way of understanding how
we believe something exists and operates. In chemistry, ball-and-stick models
and space-filling models help us visualize the structures and shapes of molecules.
Ball-and-stick models, like the pentane model in Figure 5, are more effective in
showing types of covalent bonds and the angles between the bonds, but not as
good at showing molecular shape and atomic size. Space-filling models
(Figure 6) do this well.

Structural diagrams are another way to communicate molecular structure,
but less completely than 3-D models. A complete structural diagram, as in
Figure 7(a), shows all atoms and bonds; a condensed structural diagram, as in
Figure 7(b), omits showing the C—H bonds but shows the carbon–carbon
bonds. A line structural diagram, as in Figure 7(c), is an efficient way to repre-
sent long chains of carbon atoms; the ends of each line segment represent
carbon atoms, and hydrogen atoms are not shown. Since information is left out
of any diagram, it must be replaced by your knowledge. For example, in a line
structural diagram, wherever you see fewer than four lines at an intersection, it
is assumed that H atoms are bonded there to make four bonds to each carbon.

Other variations of structural diagrams, such as Figure 7(d), (e), and (f) page 509,
are also used by some people.

Structural diagrams, in general, do not communicate the shape of the mol-
ecule. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the molecule is sacrificed
to make the communication simpler. When knowledge of the three-dimensional
character of a molecule is required, a structural diagram is replaced by a more
sophisticated diagram.

11.2 Refining Petroleum
Petroleum is a complex liquid mixture of hundreds of thousands of compounds,
most of which are hydrocarbons with 1 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule. Over
millions of years, heat and pressure deep within the Earth have transformed pre-
historic plant and bacterial material into this highly complex mixture. Those
compounds that emerge from a drilled well in gaseous form are called natural
gas and include only those compounds with low molar masses, that is, those
with one to five carbon atoms in their molecular structures. The proportions of
the components of natural gas vary from well to well. The gas that emerges from
wells usually contains carbon dioxide, CO2(g), as well, and often the extremely
toxic hydrogen sulfide, H2S(g). Natural gas that contains hydrogen sulfide is
called sour gas; this is a dangerous substance, so workers treat it with great
respect. The term natural gas is also used commercially for the fuel sold for home
and industrial heating; this fuel is refined natural gas with a high proportion of
methane, CH4(g), to which a trace of a very smelly compound has been added
(methane is odourless so ethanethiol, C2H5SH(l), is added in order to detect a
leak). Thus, the meaning of the term natural gas depends on the context in which
it is used.

Crude oil is also a complex mixture consisting primarily of hydrocarbons.
This mixture contains dissolved gases and solids but is composed of mostly
liquid components. The oil varies in consistency from heavy to light, from thick
to thin, depending on the region in the country or the world. Crude oil is often
forced from the well by the pressure of surrounding natural gas. Heavier crude
may even be in the form called heavy oil or oil (tar) sands. Heavy oil is removed
by pumping steam into the well to heat the oil so that it flows more easily, not
unlike heating honey or molasses. Oil sands are most often mined with gigantic
draglines (huge scoops on a conveyer belt). The oil film is then separated from
the sand in large rotating cylinders where hot water and sodium hydroxide are
added. The oil (bitumen) is so viscous that it needs to be semi-refined before it
can be shipped by pipeline to a conventional oil refinery. This semi-refined oil is
called synthetic crude.

Some of the liquid compounds in crude oil boil at temperatures lower than
30°C. At the other end of the scale, the least volatile components of crude oil boil
at temperatures above 400°C. The differences in boiling points of the com-
pounds making up petroleum allow us to physically separate these compounds
in a refining process called fractional distillation, or fractionation. The most
desired fraction of the original mixture is of hydrocarbon substances with 5 to
12 carbon atoms in their molecular structure because this is the basis of gasoline,
the most marketable product.

When crude oil is heated to about 500°C in the absence of air, most of its
constituent compounds vaporize. The compounds with boiling points higher
than 500°C remain unvaporized as complex hydrocarbon mixtures called
asphalts and tars, familiar materials used in road and roof surfacing. The vapor-
ized components of the petroleum rise and gradually cool as they move higher
in a metal fractionating tower (Figures 1 and 2). Where the temperature in the
higher parts of the tower is below the boiling points of the vaporized compounds
moving up the tower, the substances in the vapour begin to condense into liq-
uids. The substances with high boiling points condense in the lower, hotter parts
of the tower, and the substances with lower boiling points condense near the top
of the tower, where it’s cooler. At various levels in the tower, trays collect mixtures

of liquid substances as they condense; each mixture contains compounds with
roughly similar boiling points. These mixtures are called petroleum fractions.

The fractions with the lowest boiling points contain the smallest molecules.
The low boiling points can be explained by intermolecular forces: Small mole-
cules have fewer electrons and weaker London forces compared with large mol-
ecules. The fractions with higher boiling points contain much larger
hydrocarbon molecules. Some typical fractions are shown in Table 1, page 514.
The physical process of fractionation is then followed by chemical processes in
which the fractions are converted into more valuable products.

In the refining of petroleum, fractional distillation separates a complex mixture
into a series of mixtures, or fractions, containing similar-sized hydrocarbons.
Fractional distillation is also a very common laboratory technique for separating
mixtures so that some or all of the fractions are pure substances. The purpose of

molecular forces by separating a simple liquid mixture of organic compounds.

Cracking and Reforming Reactions

Straight fractional distillation of petroleum does not produce enough of the
gasoline fraction (called straight-run gasoline) to meet the demand for gasoline.
Other fractions, from light gas oil to paraffin (Table 1, page 514), are chemically
altered to produce more gasoline hydrocarbons with 5 to 12 carbon atoms per
molecule. Hydrocarbons in these fractions are broken into smaller fragments in
a technological process called cracking, which occurs in the absence of air. Notice
how many of the fractions in Table 1 are used as cracking stock, primarily to
make gasoline. For example, hydrocarbons of large molar mass (C15 to C18) are
converted by cracking into gasoline component hydrocarbons (C5 to C12):

C17H36(l) + H2(g) → C9H20(l) + C8H18(l)

Originally, only high temperatures in the absence of air would cause these reac-
tions in an industrial process called thermal cracking. Today, catalysts are used to
speed up the reactions and allow them to happen at lower temperatures in a
process called catalytic cracking.

The opposite of cracking is a reforming reaction. Catalysts are also used in
reforming reactions. In catalytic reforming, large molecules are formed from
smaller ones. For example, pentane can be reformed to decane:

C5H12(l) + C5H12(l) → C10H22(l) + H2(g)

Reforming may also produce molecules with more branching, which is a desir-
able characteristic for gasoline. Reforming reactions most commonly convert
low-grade (low-octane, inefficient) gasolines into higher-grades gasolines with a
higher octane rating, which is necessary for today’s highly tuned automobile
engines (Figure 4). Larger hydrocarbon molecules for synthetic lubricants and
petrochemicals can also be made by reforming smaller hydrocarbons.

cracking: reaction of a larger hydrocarbon
molecule that breaks it into two or more
smaller hydrocarbon molecules

reforming: reaction of two or more
smaller hydrocarbon molecules that combines
them into a larger or more branched hydro-
carbon molecule

Figure 4

The octane rating you see on gas pumps is
based on the scale that arbitrarily assigns
heptane a rating of zero and isooctane (a
branched form of octane) a rating of 100. The
higher the number, the better the combustion
characteristics of the fuel.

Destructive distillation is the process of heating substances to a high temperature
in the absence of oxygen. Volatile components are driven off from the substance,
which also decomposes in the process. Canadian scientist Abraham Gesner
(Figure 5) used this process extensively in his study of fossil fuels and charcoal.
In comparison, cracking is a relatively modern, controlled version of destructive
distillation applied to hydrocarbon mixtures. The purpose of this investigation is
to study changes in the destructive distillation of sawdust. Complete the Analysis

our dependence on the combustion of fossil fuels for the production of most
things that we possess: our clothes, shelter, books, and entertainment. Our way

carbons were suddenly, or even gradually, cut off (as they eventually will be), our
way of life would dramatically change.

Complete Combustion of Hydrocarbons

Combustion is a very common hydrocarbon reaction, the one that is most
familiar to us. In ideal or complete combustion, a hydrocarbon reacts with
oxygen to produce carbon dioxide gas and water vapour. All hydrocarbons burn
in air provided they are warm enough to vaporize. If the vaporization tempera-
ture (boiling point) is low and sufficient oxygen is available, the hydrocarbon
burns so rapidly it forms an explosive mixture with air. Ninety-five percent of
petroleum ends up being used as fuels in combustion reactions to produce
energy. For example,

520 Chapter 11

Recall that in hydrocarbon combustion reactions, the physical states of reac-
tants are given for SATP conditions (before any reaction), ignoring the fact that
a hydrocarbon must be vaporized to begin the reaction. The water produced is
always shown as water vapour, as it normally remains gaseous even after cooling.

So much carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels that human
activities are measurably increasing the concentration of this gas in our atmos-
phere. Many scientists are concerned that this may be contributing to an increase
in the average temperature of Earth. Of course, all the energy produced by
hydrocarbon combustion eventually transfers to the atmosphere. For example,
most Canadians know that winter temperatures are always several degrees higher
in and around large cities than they are in rural areas, due to emitted heat from
buildings, people, and vehicles.

The exploitation of fossil fuels has its consequences. On the one hand, inex-
pensive fossil fuels have contributed to our high standard of living. On the other
hand, we may be paying dearly for this good fortune. Environmental problems
such as global warming, rising costs of scarce resources, and shortages of raw
materials for the petrochemical industry are some of the disadvantages of our
dependency.

Global Warming

The chemical products of the combustion of hydrocarbons can be variable. With
sufficient oxygen present, the combustion of hydrocarbons such as methane
produces carbon dioxide and water vapour:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)

Carbon dioxide and water vapour are the two most important greenhouse
gases. These gases absorb heat radiation (long wavelength infrared) from Earth
and emit some of this radiation back to Earth (Figure 1). The term greenhouse
effect refers to the trapping of the thermal energy in the atmosphere, producing
the same effect as the glass or plastic panels of a greenhouse. The greenhouse
effect is an important natural process that has made Earth habitable. Without
this process, Earth would be cooler, and life, if there were any, would be confined
to the warm rock beneath the surface. An important current issue is the concern
about an enhanced greenhouse effect in which additional carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases, such as methane, accumulate in the atmosphere and
increase the heating effect. The resulting increase in average global temperature,
called global warming, is considered by many scientists to be the most crucial
environmental problem in the world today.

Although scientists do not completely understand the cycle of carbon
dioxide on a global scale, there is little doubt that the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is steadily increasing (Figure 2, page 522). This
increase in CO2(g) concentration is largely attributed to the combustion of fossil
fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Can an increasing concentration of CO2(g) be
absorbed in the biosphere? If not, what effect will this have on the global temper-
ature? Temperature increases of only a few degrees can cause a melting of polar
ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and significant climate changes. The lack of complete

522 Chapter 11

understanding of the natural carbon cycle means that we cannot be very cer-
tain about any predictions about global warming. Many people, including
some scientists, believe that the threat of the greenhouse effect is minimal.
Earth’s temperature has fluctuated in the past, for example, during the ice ages.
It is possible that, independent of human interference, the temperature of
Earth is increasing naturally. It is also possible Earth is in the midst of a cooling
trend and that the human-generated greenhouse effect is preventing another
ice age. Models of the atmosphere are complex but inadequate for making pre-
cise predictions. The capacity of the oceans to absorb higher levels of carbon
dioxide is not known, and the effect of an increased concentration of atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide on plant growth is not predictable.

Although the rate and extent of global warming are difficult to predict, it
seems reasonable to reduce the production of greenhouse gases to avoid upset-
ting the delicate balance of the biosphere. We can create technologies to switch
from high-carbon fuels to low-carbon fuels and use conventional fuels more effi-
ciently. We can also practise energy conservation and exploit energy sources that
do not produce carbon dioxide, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells, and
photovoltaic cells.

Canada, with about 0.5% of the world’s population, produces about 2% of
the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. In 1997, Canada was one of over 160
countries to adopt the Kyoto Protocol, which commits industrialized countries
to binding targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions of
six gases will be affected: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and three halo-
carbons used as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). As part of the agree-
ment, Canada has committed to reducing its 1990 level of greenhouse gas
emissions by 6% by the year 2012. Countries that do not meet their own emis-
sion targets can strike deals with nations that do better than required and buy
their excess “quota,” a process known as “carbon trading.” In 1997, Canada
emitted about 682 Mt of carbon dioxide, making us the eighth largest green-
house gas emitter in the world, and the fourth largest on a per capita basis.
Several factors contribute to Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions:

• Canada’s population is distributed over an enormous area, creating signifi-
cant transportation needs for people and goods.

• Canada’s northern climate places a heavy demand on energy consumption.
• A large part of Canada’s economy is resource based, which means a high

demand for energy, for example, in smelting ore.

If Canada continues with “business as usual,” it will fall far short of its target.
Canada will need innovative technological solutions to slow the trend of climate
change and to adapt to changes we cannot avoid. Equally important are changes
in the attitudes that lead us to squander energy resources.

Procedure

Part 1: Paraffin Candle

1. Light the candle in an area with little or no draft.

2. Record as many observations as possible about the candle flame.

3. Quickly move an index card into the middle of the candle flame and
remove it before it ignites. Record observations of the underside of the
card.

4. Invert the large beaker over the candle and determine the time the candle
continues to burn.

5. Examine the inside of the beaker and note any deposits.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 using the smaller beaker.

7. Remove the beaker and relight the candle. Place the short end of the glass
tubing close to the wick and gently blow air up into the candle flame
(Figure 3). Note any changes in the flame. Relight the candle if it goes out
and repeat as many times as necessary to be sure of the changes observed.

8. Place the short end of the glass tubing in the dark part of the flame just
above the wick (Figure 4). Hold it there for several minutes and describe
the vapour coming out the other end of the tubing.

9. When it looks like the maximum quantity of vapour is coming out of the
glass tubing, try lighting the vapour and observe. You may have to try this
several times.

10. Move the end of the tubing that is in the flame up near the tip of the
bright yellow region of the flame. Observe the appearance of the vapour,
and again try lighting it.

11. Remove the glass tubing from the flame and let it cool for a few minutes.
Record your observations of the outside and inside of the tube.

Part 2: Laboratory Burner

12. Connect the lab burner to the natural gas supply and make sure that the air
vents are closed.

13. Light the burner and record your observations of the flame.

14. Clean the smaller beaker with paper towel and fill it to the half to three-
quarters level with cold water.

15. Using beaker tongs, hold the beaker over the flame. Remove the beaker and
observe and record any deposits on the outside of the beaker.

16. Slowly open the air vents on the burner and record changes in the flame.

17. With the burner adjusted to obtain the usual pale blue flame, repeat steps
14 and 15.

Analysis

(a) Describe the characteristics of the candle flame, including colour and tem-
perature of different parts of the flame.

(b) What interpretation can be made about the times to extinguish the candle
in steps 4 and 6?

(c) For a normal yellow candle flame, what is one obvious product of the com-
bustion? State any Evidence for other products.

(d) When extra air is supplied to the candle flame (step 7), the colour of the
flame changes. Provide an explanation.

Long hair should be tied back
and loose sleeves should be
contained by sleeve protec-
tors or a lab coat.

Incomplete Combustion of Hydrocarbons

Ideally, the combustion of hydrocarbons produces only carbon dioxide and
water. If, however, there is insufficient oxygen available, the combustion of
hydrocarbons can also produce carbon monoxide and/or carbon. This is called
incomplete combustion.

The larger the hydrocarbon molecule, the more likely there is to be incom-
plete combustion. This is why incomplete combustion of gasoline (e.g., octane)
is more of a technological and environmental problem than for natural gas
(methane). In each of the following chemical equations, the amount of oxygen
reacting with one mole of octane is different. Note that less oxygen means less
carbon dioxide and more carbon monoxide or carbon produced.

Complete combustion:

C8H18(l) + �
2
2
5
� O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 9 H2O(g)

Some incomplete combustions:

C8H18(l) + 12 O2(g) → 7 CO2(g) + CO(g)+ 9 H2O(g)

C8H18(l) + �
2
2
3
� O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 2 CO(g)+ 9 H2O(g)

C8H18(l) + 5 O2(g) → CO(g) + 7 C(s) + 9 H2O(g)

Incomplete combustion of a fuel such as octane is undesirable for several
reasons. It decreases the fuel economy of the automobile, because less energy is
produced, and the spark plugs may become fouled with carbon. Incomplete
combustion also produces toxic carbon monoxide. Let’s review the properties of
carbon monoxide: It is a colourless, odourless gas that is usually found in con-
centrations of a few parts per million in indoor and outdoor air. Parking garages
may have levels in the range of 10–20 ppm. Up to 30 ppm is considered a safe
level of continuous exposure. Automobile emissions in large cities during rush
hours cause health problems. If there is no wind and/or there is a temperature
inversion, then headaches (a symptom of mild carbon monoxide poisoning)
become common.

Automobile emissions of carbon monoxide have been reduced in newer
models; however, older models that are not kept tuned emit carbon monoxide at
a toxic level. Parking in a car with the motor running for extended periods of
time can result in carbon monoxide poisoning if there are leaks in the exhaust
system. Faulty exhaust systems have been the cause of deaths of children and
other passengers in the back seat.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in our homes too: Backdrafts
down the furnace chimney when you are using a fireplace can result in toxic
levels of carbon monoxide in a house. Using a briquette barbecue inside the
home can also result in toxic levels of carbon monoxide. Emergency space-
heating of homes with kerosene heaters can also be lethal. Many homes now have
carbon monoxide detectors. Outside the home, every year there are reports of
campers dying after using barbecues to heat their tents.

The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, fatigue,
and unconsciousness. Be aware of situations where incomplete combustion may
occur and watch for the symptoms. Some chemical knowledge could save your
life or the lives of your family and friends.

Understanding Concepts

13. If you were looking for evidence of incomplete combustion, describe
what you would expect to find while examining the flame of a fur-
nace, the exhaust pipe of a car, and emissions from a smokestack.

14. How do the products of complete combustion and incomplete com-
bustion differ?

15. Without additional information, why is it difficult to write a balanced
chemical equation for the incomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon?

16. Heptane is a component of gasoline. Write a balanced chemical equa-
tion for the
(a) complete combustion of heptane;
(b) incomplete combustion of heptane, assuming equal amounts of

the two carbon oxides as the only carbon-containing products.

17. If the concentration of carbon monoxide from an untuned car engine
is 15 ppt, what is the percentage (parts per hundred) of carbon
monoxide in the gases at the exhaust pipe?

Making Connections

18. In some Canadian cities a bylaw requires homes to be equipped with
carbon monoxide detectors (Figure 5). How do these detectors work?
Do they have to be checked periodically? In a brief report, explain
whether you would be in favour or against such a bylaw if you
owned a home.

19. A carbon tax has been suggested as a way of reducing carbon
dioxide emissions. Its proponents believe that people who pay more
for a resource will be more likely to conserve that resource. If a
carbon tax were added differentially to various fuels, in your opinion,
which hydrocarbons should be taxed the most?

points: –0.50°C and –11.7°C. To explain this behaviour for C4H10(g), chemists
created the concept of isomers. Isomers are chemicals with the same molecular
formula but with different structural diagrams; in this text, you will study struc-
tural isomers (Figure 1) and geometric isomers. (Geometric isomers will be dis-
cussed later in this chapter.) Before we study this area further, we will see how
these hydrocarbons are identified, both by name and by their structures.

Naming Straight-Chain Alkanes

Since an important way to differentiate between isomers is to write names for the
structural formulas, it is important to be able to name straight- and branch-
chain alkanes correctly. IUPAC has created a series of internationally accepted
rules for naming alkanes.

The first syllable in the name of an alkane is a prefix that indicates the
number of carbon atoms in the longest chain in the molecule (Figure 2). The
prefixes shown in Table 1 are used in naming all organic compounds. The same
prefixes identify groups of atoms that form branches on the chains of organic
molecules.

A branch is any group of atoms that is not part of the longest continuous
carbon chain. A hydrocarbon branch is called an alkyl group. In the names of
alkyl groups, the prefixes that indicate the number of carbon atoms in the branch
group are followed by the suffix -yl (Table 2). It is very useful to learn these pre-
fixes for the first 10 alkanes in the alkane series because they occur frequently in
organic nomenclature.

After the removal of a hydrogen atom, the general formula for an alkane,
CnH2n+2, becomes CnH2n+1 in the general formula for alkyl groups. For example,
the alkane methane, CH4, becomes the alkyl group methyl, –CH3.

chain of carbon atoms. Here, the four carbon atoms tell us that the parent chain
should be called butane. The carbon atoms of a parent chain are always num-
bered from the end closest to the branch, so this isomer is called 2-methylbutane
(a butane chain with one methyl branch on the second carbon atom of the
parent chain).

In the third isomer (Figure 3(c)), two methyl groups are attached to a three-
carbon (propane) parent chain. The methyl groups are both attached to the
second carbon atom of the parent chain. Also note that every side branch must
have a separate number to identify its location. This third C5H12 isomer is named
2,2-dimethylpropane (the di means that there are two methyl branches at the
locations given by the numbers). Note the convention for the use of a comma,
hyphen, numeral, and single (combined) final word when naming branched
alkanes. Commas are used between numbers; hyphens are used between num-
bers and words; numbers are Arabic; and no spaces are used between the names
for prefixes, alkyl groups, and parent chain.

To name a branched hydrocarbon, we can organize, in steps, the guidelines
outlined in the above text. For example, write the IUPAC name corresponding to
the following structural diagram:

Step 1: The longest continuous chain has six carbon atoms. Therefore, the name
of the parent chain is hexane.
Step 2: Note which end of the parent chain is closest to the first branch. There
is a methyl branch at the second carbon atom and an ethyl branch at the third
carbon atom of the parent chain. (Also note that a branch at either end of the
chain is an extension of the parent chain.)
Step 3: With the branches named in alphabetical order, the compound
is 3-ethyl-2-methylhexane.

When writing the name of a branched alkane in a correct order, two systems
for listing the branches are commonly used. The branches are listed either (a) in
alphabetical order of branch names (ignoring the prefixes) or (b) in order of
complexity (numbers of carbon atoms in the branch). All examples and answers
in this textbook follow the alphabetical order system.

Sample Problem 1

Write the IUPAC name for the chemical with the following structural diagram:

Solution

According to the IUPAC nomenclature rules, the name for this alkane is 
4-ethyl-2-methylhexane.

The longest continuous chain must be the parent chain in an IUPAC name.
However, this parent chain need not be drawn as a straight, horizontal chain. It
is important that you follow the carbon–carbon bonds (without “backtracking”)
within a given structure. The longest, continuous chain of carbon atoms can
change directions within a structure. The following sample problem illustrates
this point.

Sample Problem 2

Write the IUPAC name for the alkane with the following structural diagram:

Solution

According to the IUPAC nomenclature rules, the name for this alkane is
3,3,5-trimethylheptane.

Naming Alkane Structures

1. Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms—the parent
chain—in the structural diagram. Number the carbon atoms in the parent
chain, always starting from the end closest to any branch(es), so the name
will have the lowest possible branch numbers.

• Remember: A branch at either end of the chain is not a branch; it is an
extension of the parent chain.

• If both ends of the parent chain are equidistant from a branch, choose the
end that gives the lowest set of numbers; for example, 2,2,4 is lower than
2,4,4.

2. Identify any branches and their location number on the parent chain.

• Each branch must have a location even if the locations of some
branches are the same.

Structural Diagrams from Alkane Names

A structural diagram can illustrate an IUPAC name. For example, 3-ethyl-
2,4-dimethylpentane is a substance used as a standard for gasoline performance.
This molecule has a pentane parent chain consisting of five carbon atoms joined
by single covalent bonds:

Numbering this straight chain from left to right establishes the location of
the branches. An ethyl branch is attached to the third carbon atom and two

Cycloalkanes

On the evidence of empirically determined formulas and observed chemical
properties, chemists have determined that organic compounds sometimes exist in
the form of alicyclic hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons with a carbon-to-carbon bond
structure forming a closed ring; acyclic hydrocarbons are open-chain hydrocar-
bons without any rings of carbon atoms. Alicyclic hydrocarbons are cyclic
aliphatics in which the two ends of the molecule have joined together to form a
ring. When all the carbon-to-carbon bonds in an alicyclic hydrocarbon are single,
the compound is called a cycloalkane. The general formula for cycloalkanes,
CnH2n, has two fewer hydrogen atoms than the general formula for alkanes
because the end carbon atoms of an alkane are now bonded to each other in a
cycloalkane. For example, cyclopropane, C3H6(g), and cyclobutane, C4H8(l)
(Figure 4), are the two simplest cycloalkanes. Notice that the names of the
cycloalkanes are derived by adding the prefix cyclo to the normal alkane name.

536 Chapter 11

Cycloalkanes and other alicyclic hydrocarbons are usually represented by
very simple line structural diagrams, drawn as regular polygons, where it is
understood that every vertex represents a carbon atom and that two hydrogen
atoms are bonded at every vertex. The 3-D ball-and-spring models in Figure 4
may be similar to physical models you are using in your classroom.

Because you are dealing only with simple cycloalkanes, you should always
consider the ring to be the parent chain when naming these hydrocarbons.
Cycloalkanes with side branches (e.g., alkyl groups) on the parent ring are named
just like open-chain alkanes, including the rule that the ring is always numbered
so that the compound name will have the lowest numerals possible for the
branches.

Properties of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes

The physical properties for all alkanes and cycloalkanes are similar (Table 3,
page 538), so the generalizations and explanations are also similar. What is said
here about the physical properties of alkanes applies to cycloalkanes as well.
Initially, when studying the physical properties of alkanes, chemists restricted
their studies to creating generalizations relating the molecular formulas of alkane
to their physical properties, such as state of matter, solubility, melting point,
boiling point, and density. For example, as the size of the chemical formula
increases,

• the state of matter at SATP moves from gas to liquid to solid
• the melting point increases
• the boiling point increases
• the density increases

The density of the condensed phases (solid and liquid) increases with the size of
the chemical formula but never beyond about 0.8 g/mL. So all alkanes are less
dense than water and float on water.

Chemists also discovered very early in their research that alkanes are 
insoluble (immiscible) in water but are soluble in benzene, C6H6(l), and carbon
tetrachloride, CCl4(l).

Later, the physical properties were explained by theories of intermolecular
bonding. For example, chemists now explain that alkanes are composed of non-
polar molecules and, therefore, do not dissolve in water, which is composed of
polar molecules. However, alkanes dissolve in benzene, C6H6(l), and carbon tetra-
chloride, CCl4(l), because their molecules are all nonpolar. (Recall that polar dis-
solves in polar and nonpolar dissolves in nonpolar.) When used as solvents
themselves, alkanes dissolve nonpolar substances but not polar or ionic substances.

The trends in states of matter and the melting and boiling points are
explained by London forces between molecules. The larger the molecule, the
larger the number of electrons and, therefore, the larger the London force
between molecules. Variations in the melting and boiling points of isomers
(which have the same number of electrons and same London forces) are
explained by the effect of the shape of the molecule on the close packing of the

Dangerous Science

Researchers who experiment with com-
pounds before the medical effects of those
compounds are well known are taking
chances with their health. The researchers
who investigated the solubilities of alkanes
in benzene and carbon tetrachloride were not
aware that these compounds are toxic and
carcinogenic. Solubility research is now done
with less hazardous compounds or under a
fume hood.

DID YOU KNOW ?



538 Chapter 11

molecules. The closer the packing, the larger the net intermolecular force. The
density of alkanes is also explained by the size of the molecule and the packing.
The larger the molecule, the more carbon atoms packed into a unit volume;
therefore, more mass per unit volume (thus, greater density).

From many studies of alkanes, chemists have shown that alkanes are gener-
ally not very reactive and when they do react at SATP, their reactions are slow.
The exception to this pattern is the complete combustion of alkanes, which,
under the right conditions, is usually so fast that it is explosive. Chemists have
created theories to explain these chemical properties of alkanes. For example,
they explain that alkanes have only single C—C and C—H bonds in their molec-
ular structures, and both kinds of single bonds are stable and not easily broken.
A lot of energy is required to break any bond in an alkane, which must happen
before any new atom can bond at that point. Alkanes have the maximum possible
number of hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon parent chain; that is, these
compounds are said to be saturated hydrocarbons. Because atoms or molecules
cannot be easily added to a saturated hydrocarbon without removing some
existing atoms, most SATP reactions of alkanes are relatively slow.

In addition to reacting very slowly at SATP, alkanes react only with very reac-
tive substances like the halogens. For example, when ethane and bromine are
mixed in the presence of light, the orange colour of the bromine disappears
slowly. A test of the products reveals that moist blue litmus turns red, which indi-
cates the production of HBr(g). As we assume one other product, the balancing
species is C2H5Br(l). A balanced chemical equation can be written from this lab-
oratory evidence:

light
C2H6(g) + Br2(l) → HBr(g) + C2H5Br(l)

This type of reaction, typical of alkanes, is called a substitution reaction. This
reaction does not occur in the dark, and in ordinary room light it is still very
slow. In the reaction, a hydrogen atom is substituted by a halogen atom as shown
more clearly with complete structural diagrams:

Note that the hydrogen atom removed from the ethane molecule bonds to one of
the bromine atoms from the original bromine molecule, Br2(l). In substitution
reactions with alkanes, usually many of the possible isomers are formed and
multiple substitutions are possible, so any chemical equation written illustrates
only one possible reaction.

The slowness of the reaction of bromine with alkanes is used as a diagnostic
test for an alkane. If bromine is added to a hydrocarbon and the reaction is slow,
then the hydrocarbon is likely an alkane.

We often think of alkanes (such as butane in lighters) as reactive because
they burn rapidly under certain conditions, but this is a special case of reaction
with oxygen (which is very reactive). Combustion does not occur unless started
by a spark or flame, in other words, at a very high temperature. Once begun,
however, combustion produces so much energy that the reaction supports itself;
some of the energy produced continually breaks new bonds to provide new
places for oxygen atoms to attach to carbons and hydrogens:

2 C4H10(g) + 13 O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 10 H2O(g) + energy

In summary, alkanes have a dual character. They undergo slow substitution
reactions or rapid (high-temperature) combustion reactions. In general, alkanes
are relatively nonreactive but can undergo explosive combustion reactions if
ignited at high temperature. Recall, also, that hydrocarbons undergo cracking
and reforming reactions, especially during the secondary refining of crude oil.

Laboratory evidence of hydrocarbon mixtures reveals that there are more kinds
of hydrocarbons than just alkanes. Molecular formula determinations reveal the
chemical formulas shown in Table 1.

Analysis of these series of hydrocarbons reveals a pattern, not only in their
formulas, but also in their chemical properties. Series 1, which you will recognize
as alkanes, are relatively unreactive compared with the other two series. The mol-
ecules in series 1 are alkanes; those in series 2 are called alkenes, and the mole-
cules in series 3 are called alkynes. Like alkanes, alkenes and alkynes each form a
homologous series:

CnH2n+2 CnH2n CnH2n�2
alkanes alkenes alkynes

To explain these series, chemists apply the theory of bonding and bonding
capacity to draw structural diagrams. The structural diagrams reveal that the
series can be explained using current theory if series 1 contains C–C single
bonds, series 2 involves one C�C double bond, and series 3 is explained by one
C�C triple bond. For example, consider the structural diagrams for the three
hydrocarbons with two carbon atoms per molecule:

544 Chapter 11

The bonding capacity of carbon requires four covalent bonds. With insufficient
hydrogen to saturate the molecule with single bonds, a double bond is required
to explain the C2H4(g) formula, and a triple bond is required to explain C2H2(g).
All alkanes, therefore, are explained as having all carbon–carbon single bonds;
alkenes have one or more double bonds; and alkynes have one or more triple
bonds.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of petroleum tells us that hydrocarbons
containing double or triple covalent bonds are relatively minor constituents.
However, these compounds are often formed during cracking reactions during
the refining of crude oil and are valuable components of gasoline. Hydrocarbons
containing double or triple bonds are vitally important in the petrochemical
industry because they are the starting materials for the manufacture of many
derivative compounds, including most kinds of plastics.

Hydrocarbons with carbon–carbon double bonds are members of the alkene
family (Figure 1). The names of alkenes with only one double carbon–carbon
bond have the same prefixes as the names of alkanes but take the suffix 
-ene (Table 2).

alkenes: a hydrocarbon family of molecules
that contain at least one carbon–carbon
double bond; general formula, CnH2n

alkynes: a hydrocarbon family of molecules
that contain at least one carbon–carbon
triple bond; general formula, CnH2n–2

Ethene and propene are the simplest members of the alkene family. Ethene, called ethylene in
the petrochemical industry, is the starting material for an enormous number of consumer, com-

The alkyne family has chemical properties that can be explained by assuming
the presence of a triple bond between carbon atoms (Figure 2). Like alkenes,
alkynes are unsaturated and react immediately with small molecules such as
hydrogen or bromine in an addition reaction; that is, the reaction allows new atoms
to add. Alkynes are named like alkenes, except for the -yne suffix. The simplest
alkyne, ethyne (acetylene), is commonly used as a high-temperature fuel
(Figure 3). In fact, C2H2(g) is the only commercially important alkyne, with huge
amounts being produced annually as fuel for welding and cutting torches and as
starting material for the manufacture of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) and many types
of plastics, as well as synthetic rubber for the tire industry. Table 3 lists the first five
members of the alkyne family. Isomers exist for all alkynes larger than propyne.

Naming Alkenes and Alkynes

Since the location of a multiple bond affects the chemical and physical proper-
ties of a compound, IUPAC decided that an effective naming system should
specify the multiple bond location. Alkenes and alkynes are named much like
alkanes, with two additional points to consider:

• The longest or parent chain of carbon atoms must contain the multiple
bond, and the chain is numbered from the end closest to the multiple bond.

• The name of the parent chain of the compound is preceded by a number
that indicates the position of the multiple bond on the parent chain.

Figure 3

The flame of an oxyacetylene torch is hot
enough to melt metals easily. Pure oxygen
reacts extremely rapidly with the triple bonds
of ethyne, releasing large quantities of
energy in a very short time.

Ethyne and propyne are the simplest members of the alkyne family. Ethyne, called acetylene in
industry, is the fuel used in welding torches. Triple bonds are the shortest and most reactive of
all carbon–carbon bonds.

• The name of any branch (e.g., alkyl group) is preceded by a number that
indicates the position of the branch on the parent chain. This is the same
procedure used with alkanes.

For example, there are two possible butene isomers: 1-butene and 2-butene. (The
isomers can also be named but-1-ene and but-2-ene, but we will not use that
system in this book.)

Sample Problem 1

Name the hydrocarbon petrochemicals (a) and (b).

Solution

The IUPAC name for (a) is 3-methyl-1-butene.
The IUPAC name for (b) is 5-methyl-2-hexene.

In the following branched alkyne structure, the parent chain is pentyne and
there is only one branch, a methyl group:

The location of the multiple bond in an alkene or alkyne takes precedence
over the location of the branches in numbering the carbon atoms of the parent
chain. The IUPAC name 4-methyl-2-pentyne follows the same format as that
used for alkanes. Branches are listed in alphabetical order. Branched alkynes are
rare.

Structural Diagrams from Alkene and Alkyne Names

Whenever you need to draw a structural diagram for any hydrocarbon, you
should always look at the end of the name to find the parent chain. You draw the
parent alkene or alkyne first and then add the branches listed in the name. Be
sure to finish the structure with sufficient hydrogen atoms to complete four
bonds of each carbon atom. The following sample problem shows some typical
examples of alkenes and alkynes.

Solutions

Cycloalkenes and cycloalkynes are classes of hydrocarbons without many
members. Chemists explain this low membership by the stress put on the double
and triple bonds by creating a cyclic hydrocarbon. However, there are such mol-
ecules as cyclohexene, a six-carbon cyclic molecule with one double bond
(Figure 4). It does not matter where the double bond is shown and no number
is necessary. There is only one cyclohexene. Cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes
with the same number of carbon atoms, both with the general formula CnH2n.
Cycloalkenes, similarly, are isomers of alkynes, both with the general formula
CnH2n–2.

Isomers of alkenes and alkynes exist for different locations of the double or
triple bond and by changing a straight-chain hydrocarbon into a branched
hydrocarbon or into a cyclic hydrocarbon. If you find that several structures have
the same formula but different names, then the structures are isomers.

Properties of Alkenes and Alkynes

Hydrocarbons with molecules containing one or more carbon–carbon double
bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes) have very similar physical properties to
alkanes of the same molar mass. Melting points, boiling points, solubilities, and
densities are all very much like those of comparable alkanes. A change of two or
four hydrogen atoms and their electrons is usually a small change in the total
number of electrons and, therefore, only a small change in London forces; how-
ever, it is sometimes measurable. For example, with two fewer hydrogen atoms,
the alkenes have a slightly lower boiling point than the alkanes (Table 4).

However, double or triple bonds between carbon atoms in the molecules
dramatically affect the chemical properties of the substance. For example, hydro-
carbons with double bonds react quickly at room temperature with bromine,
compared with alkanes, which react extremely slowly (Figure 5). Organic com-
pounds with carbon–carbon double and triple bonds are said to be unsaturated
because fewer atoms are attached to the carbon atom framework than the
number that could be attached if all the bonds were single.

Note that the reaction of a double bond allows two new atoms to add, and
the reaction of a triple bond allows up to four new atoms to add. Both of these
reactions require only a rearrangement of the electrons involved in the double
and triple bonds leaving those forming the single carbon–carbon bond unaf-
fected. These reactions—addition reactions—are generally very fast.

A diagnostic test for the presence of multiple bonds is the bromine water test
(Figure 5): If bromine water is added to a hydrocarbon and the orange bromine
colour disappears instantly, then a multiple bond is likely present. If bromine is
added and the orange colour remains, then the hydrocarbon is likely saturated,
for example, an alkane. The reaction explaining this diagnostic test is as follows,
using ethylene as an example:

CH2�CH2 + Br—Br   → CH2Br—CH2Br
colourless        orange    (fast)       colourless

This is a very fast reaction compared to the substitution reaction that satu-
rated hydrocarbons undergo:

CH3—CH3 + Br—Br   → CH3—CH2Br + H—Br
colourless      orange   (slow)       colourless        turns moist blue litmus red

The two compounds with the empirical formulas C6H12(l) and C6H10(l) have
very similar physical properties. Physical properties alone cannot be used to
identify separate samples of the two chemicals. A chemical diagnostic test that
can be used to differentiate these chemicals is the reaction with bromine water or
aqueous potassium permanganate. The slow reaction of C6H12(l) with either of
these reactants indicates the presence of single bonds, that is, a saturated com-
pound. The rapid reaction of C6H10(l) indicates the presence of multiple (double
or triple) bonds, an alkyne or cycloalkene. The simplest interpretation of these
results is that C6H12(l) is cyclohexane and C6H10(l) is cyclohexene (Figure 6).

From a theoretical perspective, cyclohexane and cyclohexene are believed to
be almost identical, except for the presence of a double bond between two carbon
atoms in cyclohexene. These compounds illustrate a relationship between 
structure and reactivity: Cyclohexene reacts rapidly with bromine water or
aqueous potassium permanganate but cyclohexane does not. The reaction is

Bromine water (a saturated aqueous solution of

equal amount of bromine water is added simul-
taneously to cyclohexane and cyclohexene, the

bromine water instantaneously, decolourizing
the orange solution. In the saturated cyclo-
hexane, there is no immediate colour change,

Analysis
(a) Answer the Question.

Geometric Isomers

In alkanes, the rotation of attached groups about the carbon–carbon single bond
is quite free. The situation is different for alkenes, where rotation about a
carbon–carbon double bond is not possible without breaking the bond.
(Molecular models are quite useful in simulating this difference in rotation
ability.) Molecular models usually provide a good 3-D representation of a mole-
cule. When you build an alkene model with a ball-and-spring model (Figure 7),
you can see that the molecule is flat with single bonds approximately 120° from
the carbon–carbon double bond. This shape and the lack of rotation about the
double bond mean that alkenes can have geometric isomers, which differ from
each other only in the position of attached groups relative to the double bond.
Unlike structural isomers, the same atoms are bonded to the same parent chain
locations, but the molecular shape differs, depending on which side of the double
bond they are attached. These are geometric isomers; they are also known as 
cis-trans isomers. The term cis means on this side, so two groups attached on
each side of the double bond are on the same side of the molecule; the term trans
means across, so two groups attached on each side of the double bond are on
opposite sides of the molecule, across from each other. For a simple example,
consider the two geometric (cis-trans) isomers of 2-butene, CH3CH�CHCH3:

Cyclohexane, cyclohexene,
acetylene, and propane are

Discovery of Acetylene

Acetylene was discovered by notable Canadian
scientist Thomas Leopold Willson (1860–1915),
who was born in Princeton, Ontario, and
attended high school at Hamilton Collegiate
Institute. An active inventor and entrepreneur,
Willson is credited with more than 60 inven-
tions, from electric arc lighting (which he
patented at age 21) to gas navigational buoys
and beacons. He is best known for his discovery
in 1892 of a more efficient process for making
calcium carbide and its byproduct, acetylene
gas. Willson’s small aluminum smelting furnace
in North Carolina produced a slag, which he
threw into the nearby stream until a large pile
accumulated. One day, upon dumping red-hot
slag into the stream, there was a dazzling burst
of flame. Willson investigated and discovered
that by adding water to the smelting furnace
slag he produced a gas that he could ignite with
a match. Willson had produced calcium carbide
and acetylene gas. Willson’s discovery of a
method to economically make calcium carbide
led to his nickname “Carbide” Willson. The dis-
covery of acetylene helped to establish the
automotive industry: The acetylene, with
oxygen, is used as fuel in the oxyacetylene
torch, an invaluable tool in metal cutting and
welding.

The Diversity of Organic Molecules

You have studied relatively small alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and their correspon-
ding cyclic compounds. You have also seen examples of both structural and geo-
metric isomers. Now consider that there can easily be hydrocarbons with
hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. There are also numerous hydrocarbon
derivatives containing carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetal atoms. And there
are also many other kinds of isomers. So you can imagine that there must be a
staggering number of organic molecules. Of the more than 10 million com-
pounds known, at least 90% are molecular compounds of the element carbon.
The number of known compounds of carbon far exceeds the number of com-
pounds of all other elements combined. This observation is explained by
chemists as resulting from the combination of several properties of carbon:

• Carbon is a small atom that can form four bonds, more than atoms of
most other elements.

• Carbon atoms have the special property of being able to bond together to
form chains, rings, spheres, sheets, and tubes of almost any size (Figure 9).

• Carbon can form multiple combinations of single, double, and triple cova-
lent bonds with itself and with atoms of other elements.

Polymers

Polymers are substances whose molecules are made up of many similar small
molecules (monomers) linked together in long chains. Polymerization is the for-
mation of polymers from many monomers. These compounds have long existed
in nature but were only synthesized by technological processes in the 20th cen-
tury. They have molar masses up to millions of grams per mole.

Addition Polymers

Many plastics are produced by the polymerization of alkenes. For example, poly-
ethene (polyethylene) is made by polymerizing ethene molecules in a reaction
known as addition polymerization. Polyethylene is used to make plastic insulation
for wires and containers such as plastic milk bottles, refrigerator dishes, and labora-
tory wash bottles. Addition polymers are formed when monomers join each other
in a process that involves the rearranging of electrons in double or triple bonds in
the monomer. In addition polymerization, the polymer is the only product formed.

Using tetrafluoroethene instead of ethene in an addition polymerization
reaction produces the substance polytetrafluoroethene, commonly known as
Teflon. Teflon has properties similar to polyethylene, such as a slippery surface and
a nonreactive nature. But Teflon has a much higher melting point than polyeth-
ylene, so it is used to coat cooking utensils. Polypropene (polypropylene),
polyvinyl chloride, Plexiglas, polystyrene, and natural rubber are also addition
polymers (Figure 10, page 556).

Careers in the Petrochemical Industry

Petrochemical Engineer

Industrial engineering is fundamentally concerned with making
processes more efficient and dependable. A petrochemical engineer
must understand the chemistry of the reactions, the physical changes
that occur, and the technology of the equipment and power require-
ments for those processes occurring in the industrial workplace.
Engineers are expected to operate in a supervisory capacity, directing
the efforts of teams of other employees. Engineers are also expected
to report findings and procedures in written reports, published papers,
and audiovisual presentations to interested groups.

Refinery Laboratory Technician

Lab technicians are generally concerned with testing and
analysis, both to monitor and control refinery processes and to
do testing for projects involving research into improvements and
changes. Familiarity with reaction and bonding theory is essen-
tial, as are the ability to operate a wide variety of technological
equipment and the skills to perform analytical techniques.

Plastics Technologist

Plastics technologists work with a wide range
of different materials, matching properties of
different plastics to specialized applications.
They are concerned with recycling technology,
measurement, testing, and fabrication tech-
niques controlled largely by the chemistry of,
and bonding structure within, any of the
myriad types of plastic materials.
Petrochemicals supply the raw materials for
the manufacture of most types of plastics.

Petroleum Geologist

Geologists who work in the petrochemical industry require
specialized knowledge about the geological formations associ-
ated with underground petrochemical deposits. They work
extensively with rocks and minerals in test drilling cores and
with charts from seismic exploration of underground strata.
They must also be familiar with characteristics of fossil fuels
under extreme pressure and temperature conditions. Their
work may extend into such interesting and exotic areas as
examining the increased likelihood of earthquakes in regions
where large amounts of materials are removed from under-
ground deposits.

Many areas of industry and commerce begin with the production of
petrochemicals from petroleum; only a few of the many associated
careers are shown here.

(b) the education required to qualify for employment in this field;
(c) the current working conditions, opportunities, and salary for an

employee in this field.

30. The Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who is often
called the father of modern chemistry, divided com-
pounds into inorganic and organic categories. He
believed organic compounds could only be produced by
the action of living things. The first experiment sug-
gesting that this theory was unacceptable was per-
formed in 1828 by Berzelius’s student and lifelong
friend, German chemist Friedrich Wöhler. Wöhler
heated the inorganic compound ammonium cyanate,
NH4OCN(s), and discovered that crystals forming from
the vapour were urea, H2NCONH2(s), a well-known
organic compound that is a waste product of all mam-
mals. While we now consider Wöhler’s experiment a
turning point, the scientific community was only finally
convinced primarily by the later work of the French
chemist Pierre Eugène Marcelin Berthelot (1827–1907).

Energy from
Hydrocarbons
We use the term “energy” in everyday language in many different ways. Sometimes
we say that we have “no energy” to do chores or that an active child is “full of
energy.” We get “energy” from breakfast cereals. We are mindful of not wasting
“energy” by leaving the lights on unnecessarily. Our society is preoccupied by
energy—its availability, management, benefits, and future sources. Perhaps that’s
because we use so much of it. North Americans consume more than one-quarter
of the world’s energy output, much of it from nonrenewable resources.

Our society depends on heat and on mechanical and electrical energy
(Figure 1). However, as the old saying goes, “You can’t get something for
nothing.” These valued forms of energy must come from other energy forms. The
source of heat and mechanical and electrical energy for technological uses is
almost entirely chemical energy from fossil fuels. Burning natural gas in furnaces
keeps us warm; we rely on gasoline burned in car engines to travel from one place
to another; and electrical utility companies burn natural gas, oil, or coal and con-
vert the released heat into electricity. Our dependence on fossil fuels comes with
costs both for ourselves and for others. Rapidly increasing fuel prices may finally
force our society to seriously consider our reliance on fossil fuels, and how our
demand for energy affects much poorer people in nations that do not have suf-
ficient energy.

In this chapter, you will study energy changes from the combustion of
hydrocarbons. You will learn how these energy changes can be calculated from
laboratory evidence. You will also gain an understanding of both the usefulness
and the impact of the combustion of fossil fuels.

In this chapter, you will be 

able to

• explain the role of heat in energy
changes in chemical reactions;

• distinguish between heat and
temperature;

• identify, measure, and describe
the three factors that determine
the quantity of heat transferred in
an energy change;

• compare the energy changes
observed in endothermic and
exothermic reactions and explain
using changes in chemical bonds;

• describe energy changes in
endothermic and exothermic
reactions;

• communicate heat transferred in
chemical reactions as part of 
thermochemical equations;

• use the energy terms heat, heat
capacity, specific heat, specific
heat capacity, heat of reaction,
and molar heat of reaction;

• conduct experiments to construct
an energy device using the com-
bustion of a hydrocarbon;

• obtain and analyze experimental
evidence in calorimetry experi-
ments; 

• demonstrate an understanding of
the importance of hydrocarbons
as fuels and as sources for other
products and identify the risks
and benefits of these uses to
society and the environment.

What does it mean when something gets hot or cold? If the “some-
thing” is a pot on a hot stove element or an ice-cube tray in a freezer,
then this seems like a simple process. But what if the “something” is a
combination of chemicals that mix and react? What is happening in this
case?

Materials: eye protection, a small (sandwich-size) resealable plastic bag,
small beaker or graduated cylinder, laboratory scoop or plastic spoon,
water, calcium chloride, citric acid, and sodium hydrogen carbonate
(baking soda) solids

As a general precaution, wash your hands if you come into
contact with any of the substances or solutions.

• Measure about 10 mL of water in the beaker or graduated cylinder.
• Place about 5 mL (approximately 1 tsp.) of calcium chloride solid in

one bottom corner of a dry, plastic bag.
• Fold up and hold the corner of the bag containing the solid. Add the

water to the opposite corner of the bag so that it is kept separate
from the solid. Seal the bag.

• Grasp the top of the bag and allow the water and the solid to mix.
Tilting the bag back and forth will ensure mixing.

• Hold the bottom of the bag in your hand.
• Record all observations from the initial mixing until no further

changes occur.
• Dispose of the contents into the sink. Rinse and dry the inside of the

bag.
• Repeat the above procedure, replacing the calcium chloride solid

with about 5 mL (approximately 1 tsp.) each of citric acid and baking
soda solids in the same corner of the bag and the water in the oppo-
site corner.

(a) Which mixture felt hot after mixing with water? Where did the
heat come from?

(b) Did you notice any change when the dry solids were added
together?

(c) Describe the changes when water was added to the second mix-
ture. What role does the water play?

(d) What does it mean when something feels cold? Is “cold” being
transferred from the contents of the bag to your hand?

(e) Which of the two combinations you tested showed an
endothermic change? an exothermic change?

12.1 Classifying Energy Changes
Energy is essential to both life itself and our way of life: Breathing, digestion, the
beating of our hearts, and the production of our food, shelter, and clothing all
depend on energy. We are more and more dependent on our personal energy
devices, such as radios, televisions, computers, and motorized vehicles. And our
society demands energy to maintain itself, for example, to run our governments and
businesses and to transport people and goods. Where does this energy come from?
An energy resource is a natural substance or process that provides a useful form of
energy from one of four basic energy sources (Table 1). For example, coal, oil, and
natural gas are natural resources whose chemical energy we convert into heat and
other forms of energy (Figure 1). Nuclear energy stored in uranium atoms, for
example, is the energy source for nuclear reactors, which produce heat and elec-
tricity (Figure 2). Radiant energy from the Sun, or solar energy, and geothermal
energy from Earth are used as energy sources to a limited extent. Unfortunately,
these two energy sources are often too variable or produce too little energy; in the
case of the geothermal sources, these natural resources are often too far from pop-
ulated areas. A significant solar energy resource is the water in rivers, which is used
by hydroelectric power generating stations.

As you have learned in previous studies, energy can be converted from one
form to another. In fact, most of our scientific understanding of energy comes
from studying changes in the forms of energy.

1. List two energy-consuming devices that you use every day that are
essential, two that are practical, efficient, or convenient, and two that
are nonessential.

2. For each example in question 1, use Table 1 to identify
(a) the technologically useful form of energy;
(b) the energy source and the natural resource from which the

energy was obtained.

3. The nonrenewable nature of fossil fuels and their rising costs will
likely force more conservation as well as a search for alternatives.
List three examples of energy-conserving strategies or products that
you or someone you know could use.

chemical energy: energy derived directly
from a chemical reaction; for example,
burning of hydrocarbons in a furnace

nuclear energy: energy derived directly
from a nuclear reaction; for example, a
nuclear reactor for production of electricity

solar energy: energy directly and 
indirectly from solar radiation; for example,
directly through a window or indirectly
through the water cycle or winds

geothermal energy: energy from the
heat of the Earth; for example, water pumped
into and out of hot rock

12.1

Heat

Most familiar forms of energy are eventually converted to thermal energy, that is,
the temperature of a substance is increased. Let’s look at a few examples. The
chemical energy from the combustion of gasoline in a car engine is converted
mostly to thermal energy and partly to energy of motion of the car, which in turn
is also converted to thermal energy by frictional forces.

The electrical energy used to operate a TV set is converted mostly to thermal
energy and to some light and sound energy. The light and sound energy allow us
to view and listen to the TV show, but this energy is absorbed by materials in the
surroundings and converted to thermal energy. People obtain energy from food
and lose energy as body heat and in the form of excretions (Figure 3). This
transfer of energy as heat (whether by conduction, convection, or radiation)
results in an increase in the thermal energy of the surroundings. So, heat is the
energy being transferred between substances. An object possesses thermal energy
but cannot possess heat.

In order to measure the heat transferred, scientists measure the change in
temperature with a thermometer to calculate the change in thermal energy.
When the thermal energy changes, heat has been transferred. Consider the evi-

Scanning down the heat and mass columns, we can see that the heat trans-
ferred and the mass of water and an oil are systematically manipulated to deter-
mine their effect on the temperature of the two liquids. According to this
evidence, the temperature change, ∆t, of a substance in a system or its surround-
ings varies directly with the quantity of heat, q, flowing into or out of the sub-
stance. Increasing the heat, q, gained increases the temperature change, ∆t (see
trials 1–4). Graphing the evidence shows that the temperature change varies
inversely with the mass of the substance (Figure 4, page 568). Increasing the mass,
m, of a substance decreases the temperature change, ∆t (see trials 1, 5, 6, and 7).

Note also in Table 2 and Figure 4 that the change in temperature is
dependent on the type of substance involved, in this case, water or an oil. In every
instance, the oil increases in temperature more than the water does. The compo-
sition of the substance affects the temperature change. Every substance has what

is called its specific heat capacity, a constant. The larger the temperature change,
the smaller the specific heat capacity for a particular substance. A substance is
said to have a large specific heat capacity when a relatively large quantity of heat
must flow to produce a given temperature change per unit mass of the substance.
(Recall that the SI unit for energy is the joule, J.)

The specific heat capacity, c , is the quantity of heat required to change the
temperature of a unit mass (e.g., one gram) of a substance by one degree Celsius.
For example, as calculated in the analysis of evidence from Table 2, the specific
heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g�°C). This means that 4.18 J of energy is required
to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. The same
quantity of energy is released by one gram of water if its temperature decreases by
one degree Celsius. The oil analyzed is a typical component of motor oil, which
lubricates and cools car motors. Its specific heat capacity is considerably smaller
than that of water. Compared to most other substances, water has a very high spe-
cific heat capacity.

Specific heat capacities vary for different substances and for different states
of matter. See, for example, the specific heat capacities for the three states of
water and for some other chemicals in Table 3. When calculating the quantity of
heat that flows into or out of a substance, the value of the specific heat capacity
must correspond to both the state of matter of the substance and the measured
quantity (mass or volume) of the substance. For example, calculation of the
quantity of heat flowing into a measured mass of ice requires the use of the spe-
cific heat capacity for H2O(s), 2.01 J/(g�°C). If necessary, you may have to use the
density of the substance to convert from mass to volume or vice versa. Note that
in this book, quantities of heat transferred are calculated as absolute values by
subtracting the lower temperature from the higher temperature.

Endothermic and Exothermic Changes

When heat is transferred between a system and its surroundings, evidence
obtained from measurements of the temperature of the surroundings is used to
classify the change as exothermic or endothermic. Exothermic changes usually
involve an increase in the temperature of the surroundings (Figure 8), that is, the
system has transferred heat to the surroundings (exo means “outside”). An
example of an exothermic change is the burning of hydrocarbons. Endothermic
changes usually involve a decrease in the temperature of the surroundings
(Figure 8), that is, the system has absorbed heat from the surroundings (endo
means “inside”). An example of an endothermic change is the cooking of foods.

It is important to have a clear understanding of the relationship among heat,
thermal energy, and temperature. Recall the kinetic molecular theory from ear-
lier chapters: Any moving object has kinetic energy (Ek), and, because the mole-
cules of a substance are always colliding, at any instant some molecules are
moving faster than others. Therefore, in a large group of molecules there will be
a range of kinetic energies from very low to very high values.

The thermal energy available from a substance is related to the total kinetic
energy of all of the molecules. As long as there are no changes in state, the
transfer of heat to a substance causes faster molecular motion, increasing both
the temperature, which is related to the average kinetic energy, and the thermal
energy, which is related to the total kinetic energy, of the substance. Therefore, a
change in the temperature of the substance, as measured with a thermometer, is
explained theoretically as a change in the average kinetic energy of the particles
in the substance. This change in the average kinetic energy is represented by ∆Ek.
If the temperature of the substance has decreased and there are no changes in
state, then heat has flowed out of the substance.

(a) temperature t and kinetic energy Ek of the particles of a substance

surroundings when
(a) their temperature increases?
(b) their temperature decreases?
(c) an exothermic change occurs?

(a) cooking pasta on an electric element on a stove
(b) burning methane or propane in a barbecue

a chemical system to the surroundings.

surroundings; energy is transferred as heat

A water heater is an insulated container with an energy source to heat the water.
The insulation is not perfect, so the water tends to cool as heat flows from the
container to the surroundings. In this investigation you will design, build, and
evaluate a water heater. To evaluate your heater, you will use two criteria: specific
heat, the heat transferred per unit mass, and cooling rate, the heat flowing out
of a substance per unit time. The better the water heater, the higher the specific
heat in joules per kilogram and the lower the cooling rate in joules per minute.

The purpose of this investigation is to practise technological problem-
solving skills related to an energy system by designing, building, and evaluating
a water heater. As you test your design in the Procedure, record all of your obser-
vations, including unexpected ones. Record any modifications made to your
device. For specific heat, use a temperature change from room temperature to
60°C. For the lab report, complete the Hypothesis, Experimental Design,
Materials, Analysis, and Evaluation sections.

12.2 Calorimetry
When you put a kettle of water on a hot stove element, a pizza in a hot oven, or
jump into a cool lake on a hot summer day, heat is transferred. And, according
to one of the fundamental laws of energy (known as the laws of thermo-
dynamics), heat always transfers from a hotter object to a cooler object. What
about the change in energy of the two objects? According to the law of conserva-
tion of energy, energy is neither created nor destroyed in any physical or chem-
ical change. In other words, energy is only converted from one form to another.

To study energy changes, we need carefully designed experiments plus an
isolated system, that is, one in which no energy can move in or out. If no energy
is allowed to move between the inside and the outside of an isolated system, we
can more easily study energy changes within the system. An example of such a
system is called a calorimeter (Figure 1). Precise measurements are also needed;
the process of measuring energy changes in chemical systems is called
calorimetry. Inside the calorimeter, the chemical system being studied is sur-
rounded by a known quantity of water (known as the “surroundings”). Energy is
transferred between the chemical system and the water. Water is used not only
because it is readily available, but also because it has one of the highest specific
heat capacities. For example, to determine the energy required to melt ice, the ice
may be placed in water inside a calorimeter. As the ice melts, heat transfers from

the water to the ice. The total energy gained by the ice is equal to the energy lost
by the calorimeter water, as long as both the ice (system) and the water (sur-
roundings) are part of an isolated system. In other words, for measurements to
be accurate, no energy may be transferred between the inside of the calorimeter
and the environment outside the calorimeter.

The specific heat capacities listed in Table 3, page 568, were determined by
means of calorimetry. A variety of physical changes, such as changes in state, dis-
solving, and dilution, can be studied using calorimeters. The dissolving of sub-
stances in water may involve noticeable energy changes. The cold packs used in
sports to treat sprains and bruises are a practical application of this fact. These
packs contain a chemical that absorbs heat from the surroundings when it dis-
solves in water. The result is that the temperature of the injured part of the body
(the surroundings) decreases, which reduces the severity of the injury.

Analysis of calorimetric evidence is based on the law of conservation of
energy and on several assumptions. The law of conservation of energy may be
expressed in several ways, for instance, “The total energy change of the chemical
system is equal to the total energy change of the calorimeter surroundings.”
Using this approach, we can calculate both the energy change of the chemical
system, �E, and the quantity of heat, q, as absolute values, without using a posi-
tive or a negative sign:

�E = q

(system) (calorimeter)

The main assumption is that no heat is transferred between the calorimeter and
the outside environment. Another assumption is that any heat absorbed or
released by the calorimeter materials, such as the container, is negligible. Also, a
dilute aqueous solution is assumed to have the same density and specific heat
capacity as pure water.

The energy change of the chemical system, �E, depends on two quantities: the
mass of chemical (directly related to the number of particles that make it up) and
the energy constant for the change occurring (related to the particular chemical
and the changes in the bonding). One common way to specify the energy constant
is as a specific heat, h, the energy absorbed or released per unit mass of a chemical:

�E = mh

Usually we specify the type of change occurring, such as the specific heat of
melting, solution (dissolving), or combustion, by including a subscript with the
energy terms. For example, in a calorimetry experiment, 4.2 g of lithium chloride
is dissolved in 100 mL (100 g) of water at an initial temperature of 16.3°C. The final
temperature of the solution is 25.1°C. To calculate the specific heat of solution, hs,
for lithium chloride, the first step is to use the law of conservation of energy:

�Es = q

(LiCl dissolving) (calorimeter water)

In other words, the heat lost by dissolving of the lithium chloride equals the heat
gained by the calorimeter water (surroundings). The energy change of lithium
chloride dissolving to form a solution depends on the specific heat (in kilojoules
per gram) and the mass (in grams); the heat gained by the water is expressed in
the usual heat formula, mc�t:

mhs = mc∆t

Since the temperature of the water in the calorimeter increases, the dissolving of
lithium chloride is exothermic. Therefore, the specific heat of solution for
lithium chloride is reported as an exothermic 0.88 kJ/g.

Hot and cold packs usually contain a chemical and water. The hot-pack chemical
has an exothermic specific heat of solution, and the cold-pack chemical has an
endothermic specific heat of solution. The purpose of this investigation is to

Bomb Calorimeters and Heat Capacity

Many chemical reactions that are of interest to chemists and engineers do not
take place in aqueous solutions. An important practical example is combustion.
Oil companies are always researching better gasolines, and one important char-
acteristic of gasoline is the heat released during combustion. A calorimeter made
of polystyrene cannot be used to study the energy changes of combustion reac-
tions, since polystyrene has a low melting point and burns readily. So how do we
study combustion reactions?

These types of reactions can be studied by using a bomb calorimeter
(Figure 3). The inner reaction compartment is called a bomb because in early

The reactants are placed inside the

the calorimeter water. Once the calorimeter
is sealed and the initial temperature meas-
ured, the combustion reaction is initiated by
an electric heater or spark. Stirring is essen-
tial in order to obtain a uniform final 
temperature for the water.

models it often exploded. Modern bomb calorimeters are strong enough to with-
stand explosive reactions. The energy change of the reaction is determined from
the temperature change of the calorimeter.

Researchers use bomb calorimeters to measure energy changes for the com-
bustion of fuels, oil, foodstuffs, certain crops, and explosives. But calorimeters
that are larger and more sophisticated than polystyrene cups usually have a
noticeable heat transfer to or from the components of the calorimeter. It is no
longer possible to ignore the calorimeter materials as we did with the simple
polystyrene calorimeter. The total energy change of the calorimeter is the sum of
the energy changes of all of the components of the calorimeter:

∆Etotal = m1c1∆t + m2c2∆t + m3c3∆t + m4c4∆t
(calorimeter) (water) (containers) (stirrer) (thermometer)

Because the temperature change, �t, is identical for all components and the same
components are used over and over again, this total energy calculation can be
simplified. The different constants in the equation can be replaced by a single
constant, C, the heat capacity of the particular calorimeter:

∆E total = (m1c1 + m2c2 + m3c3 + m4c4) ∆t
∆E total = C∆t, where C is the heat capacity of the calorimeter

The total energy absorbed by the calorimeter is the energy transferred from the
chemical system as heat, q. Therefore,

q � C�t for a bomb calorimeter

Manufacturers may provide a value for the heat capacity of the calorimeter,
or the calorimeter may be calibrated by the user with a well-known standard
before it is used for calorimetric analysis. Suppose a 1.50-g sample of sucrose,
together with excess oxygen gas, is placed in the bomb of a calorimeter whose
heat capacity is specified by the manufacturer as 8.57 kJ/°C. The temperature
changes from 25.00°C to 27.88°C. What is the specific heat of combustion for
sucrose? According to the law of conservation of energy, the energy released from
the combustion (�Ec) equals the total heat transferred (q) to the calorimeter:

∆Ec = q
(sucrose) (calorimeter)

The energy change for the chemical system is calculated, as before, using the mass
and specific heat, and the total energy change of the calorimeter as C�t:

582 Chapter 12

12.3 Heats of Reaction
All chemical reactions involve energy changes. Some reactions like combustion
(burning) are obviously exothermic. You can feel the heat and see the light
emitted from a burning campfire or fireplace. In an exothermic reaction, energy
is a product just like the chemical products of the reaction. Exothermic reactions
always release energy into the surroundings:

reactants → products � energy

Endothermic reactions are less familiar in everyday life, but not unknown. If you
put an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a glass of water, a chemical reaction takes place, as
evidenced by the gas bubbles produced. If you feel the glass, you will notice that
it feels cold. The reaction is absorbing heat from the surroundings (water, glass,
air). In an endothermic reaction, energy is consumed like a reactant.
Endothermic reactions always absorb energy from the surroundings:

reactants � energy → products

You have used calorimetry to determine the specific heat of reaction for a
particular substance. Now we can use this experimental value to write a chemical
equation that includes the heat transferred. This chemical equation is called a
thermochemical equation, and the quantity of heat transferred is called the heat
of reaction.

A chemical equation communicates the relative amounts, in moles, of all
reactants and products. To be able to relate experimentally measured specific
heats to chemical equations, the energy must be expressed as a quantity of heat
per mole, such as kilojoules per mole; this quantity is called the molar heat of
reaction, �Hr, for a particular substance. For example, the specific heat of com-
bustion of octane, from a calorimetry experiment, is an exothermic 44.41 kJ/g.
How can this be converted into a molar heat of combustion?

First, a conversion factor to convert kilojoules per gram into kilojoules per
mole must be found. The mass in grams must be converted into an amount in
moles. As you will recall from Unit 2, the conversion factor that was created by
chemists to complete this conversion is the molar mass of the chemical. Using the
molar mass as a conversion factor, we can convert the specific heat of combus-
tion of octane, hc, into the molar heat of combustion of octane, �Hc :

�Hc = �

This means that the combustion of one mole of octane releases 5074 kJ of
heat. Notice how the units cancel in the above calculation. Cancelling units is
always a good procedure to check to see if you are calculating correctly.

Molar heats of reaction must always specify the type of reaction (in this case
the subscript used is “c” for combustion) and the substance reacted (in this case
octane, C8H18(l)).

Thermochemical Equations

To combine a calculated molar heat of reaction with a chemical equation, you need
to pay particular attention to the balancing of the equation. For example, the molar
heat of combustion of octane (a major component of gasoline) is 
5074 kJ/mol. Because combustion reactions are always exothermic, this means that
5074 kJ of heat is transferred to the surroundings during the combustion of one
mole of octane. If we balance the chemical equation using “1” as the coefficient for
octane, we can write the heat of reaction immediately without any calculations:

1 C8H18(l) + �
2
2
5
� O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 9 H2O(g) + 5074 kJ

This equation is read as “one mole of octane reacts with twelve and a half (25/2)
moles of oxygen to produce eight moles of carbon dioxide, nine moles of water,
and five thousand and seventy-four kilojoules of heat.” Of course, you may still
write the balanced chemical equation with whole-number coefficients, but the
heat of reaction must be doubled because 2 mol of octane are shown:

2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g) + 10 148 kJ

The heat term is part of the balanced equation, and if the coefficients are
changed, then the heat of reaction is changed in the same way. In the previous
example, if the coefficients are doubled, then the energy is doubled. This is nec-
essary so that the equation agrees with the empirical molar heat of reaction, as
shown below:

To write a thermochemical equation, it is necessary to know the balanced
chemical equation, the molar heat of reaction for one substance in the equation, and
whether the reaction is endothermic (takes in energy) or exothermic (gives out
energy). If a reaction is endothermic, remember to put the heat of reaction on the
reactant side of the chemical equation. This heat is consumed, or used up, like the
reactants and is listed along with the reactants. For example, the decomposition of

584 Chapter 12

nize, so you will be given this information as part of any question. The only excep-
tion is a combustion reaction, which you are expected to know is exothermic.

11. Do endothermic and exothermic only apply to chemical reactions? What
are some other changes that can also be endothermic or exothermic?

A Theoretical Perspective on Energy Change

Energy transfer is an important factor in all chemical changes. Exothermic reac-
tions, such as the combustion of gasoline in a car engine or the metabolism of
fats and carbohydrates in a human body (Figure 2), release energy into the sur-
roundings. Endothermic reactions, such as photosynthesis (Figure 3) or the
decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen, remove energy from the sur-
roundings. Knowledge of energy and energy changes is important to society and
to industry, and the study of energy changes provides chemists with important
information about chemical bonds. How do we explain the energy changes
measured in calorimeters in terms of molecules, atoms, and bonds?

Just as glue holds objects together, electrical forces hold atoms together. In
order to pull apart objects that are glued together, you have to supply some energy.
Similarly, if atoms or ions are bonded together, energy is required to separate
them. Separated atoms or ions release energy when they bond together again:

bonded particles + energy → separated particles
separated particles             → bonded particles + energy

The stronger the bond holding the particles together, the greater the energy
required to separate them. Bond energy is the energy required to break a chem-
ical bond. It is also the energy released when a bond is formed. Even the simplest
of chemical reactions may involve the breaking and forming of several individual
bonds. The terms exothermic and endothermic are empirical descriptions of
overall changes that can be explained by knowledge of bond changes. Consider
the decomposition of water, for example:

2 H2O(l) � energy → 2 H2(g) + O2(g)

The easiest way to supply the energy for this decomposition is electrically. This is
known as the electrolysis of water. In this endothermic reaction,
hydrogen–oxygen bonds in the water molecules must be broken before the
hydrogen–hydrogen and oxygen–oxygen bonds in the products can be formed.

Figure 2

In the human body, exothermic chemical
reactions occur as fats and carbohydrates are
metabolized.

Figure 3

Plants use energy from the Sun in a series of
endothermic reactions called photosynthesis.

bond energy: the energy required to
break a chemical bond; the energy released
when a bond is formed



Energy from Hydrocarbons 587

Breaking bonds requires energy and forming bonds releases energy. We know
experimentally that the decomposition of water is endothermic, which means
that it requires a constant input of energy to keep reacting. The theoretical inter-
pretation is that it must take more energy to break the bonds in the reactants
than is released when the new bonds in the products form (Figure 4).

For exothermic reactions, such as the formation of hydrogen chloride, the
opposite is true (Figure 5). Exothermic reactions produce energy that transfers
to the surroundings, usually as heat. In this case, more energy is believed to be
released in forming new bonds than is absorbed in breaking bonds in the reac-
tants. This is true for all exothermic reactions, including the combustion of fuels.

12.4 Our Use of Fossil Fuels
As you can see from Figure 1, Canadians are the world’s second largest per capita
consumers of energy. Approximately 45% of total energy production in Canada
ends up as waste in the form of heat lost in the generation and transmission of
electricity. The amount of energy lost is more than that available to many devel-
oping countries to support their populations and economies.

Figure 2 (page 592) shows the energy consumption by Canadians from var-
ious sources between 1871 and 1998. As you can see, by 1900, fossil fuels had
replaced wood as the main energy source. By 1950, fluid fossil fuels such as oil
and natural gas had largely replaced coal.

By 1985, fossil fuels accounted for about 87% of total energy use in Canada.
Energy from hydroelectric sources (river dams) accounted for 11% and energy
from nuclear reactors, 2%. Our dependence on fossil fuels for energy is likely to
continue well into the 21st century.

Figure 1

Per capita energy consumption by country
(1997)



592 Chapter 12

Canada’s high energy use is due partly to the severity of our climate and the
huge area over which our small population is distributed. We heat our homes for
a larger portion of the year, and we travel farther than people in other countries.
Our consumer goods must also travel farther. Attitudes toward energy use and
conservation are also factors in our high consumption level. For example, many
people believe that since we have the fuel now, we will always have it. However, if
these people become convinced by the available evidence that the fossil fuel
resource is finite and nonrenewable, then they take the attitude that future gen-
erations will solve the shortage when actually confronted with it.

What are some alternatives to fossil fuels as our main energy source? Options
include both the use of different fuels and more economical management of the
fossil fuels still available to us (Table 1).

Petrochemicals from Fossil Fuels

Currently, about 95% of our fossil fuel production is burned to provide energy
and less than 5% is used to produce petrochemicals. The variety and volume of
products made from petrochemicals give yet another clue as to just how much of
the nonrenewable resources is burned. Petrochemicals are used to produce plas-
tics, synthetic fibres, pharmaceuticals, soaps, solvents, fertilizers, insecticides, and
refrigerants, to name a few. The economic importance of petrochemicals lies in
the fact that basic raw organic materials are processed and reprocessed many
times to produce this huge range of products. That means many job opportuni-
ties. Using ethylene (ethene) as an example, Figure 4 shows the number of jobs
involved in some industries that rely on petrochemicals.

For every 11 jobs involved in the manufacture of ethylene, 116 jobs are cre-
ated in manufacturing chloroethylene (vinyl chloride), 600 jobs in manufacturing
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and over 6000 jobs in manufacturing other commercial
and consumer products such as pipes and tiles made from the PVC plastic. And
vinyl chloride is only one of many secondary products manufactured from eth-
ylene. If other petrochemicals such as methane and propylene (propene) are con-
sidered, the number of products produced and jobs created is enormous. By
comparison, simply burning fossil fuels seems like a waste of a valuable resource.

carbon atoms per molecule. Oil refineries use a variety of physical and chemical
methods to produce gasolines with different properties (Figure 2).

Now that you have finished Unit 5, you will have the opportunity to demon-
strate your understanding of hydrocarbons, using gasoline as an example.

606 Appendix A1

Planning an Investigation
In our attempts to further our understanding of the natural
world, we encounter questions, mysteries, or events that are
not readily explainable. We can use controlled experiments,
correlational studies, or observational studies to attempt to
answer these questions or explain the events. The methods
used in scientific inquiry depend, to a large degree, on the
purpose of the inquiry.

Controlled Experiments

A controlled experiment is an example of scientific inquiry in
which an independent variable is purposefully and steadily
changed to determine its effect on a second dependent vari-
able. All other variables are controlled or kept constant.
Controlled experiments are performed when the purpose of
the inquiry is to create, test, or use a scientific concept.

The common components of controlled experiments are
outlined in the flow chart below. Even though the sequence is
presented as linear, there are normally many cycles through the
steps during the actual experiment.

Choose a topic that interests
you. Determine whether you are
going to create, test, or use a
scientific concept and whether
you are going to carry out a
given procedure or develop a
new experimental design.
Indicate your decision in a
statement of the purpose.

Your question forms the basis
for your investigation.
Controlled experiments are
about relationships, so the
question could be about the
effects on variable A when vari-
able B is changed. The question
may also be about what causes
the change in variable A. In this
case, you might speculate
about possible variables and
determine which variable
causes the change.

A hypothesis is a tentative
explanation. You must be able
to test your hypothesis, which
can range in certainty from an
educated guess to a concept
that is widely accepted in the
scientific community. A predic-
tion is based upon a hypothesis
or a more established scientific
explanation, such as a theory.
In the prediction you state what
outcome you expect from your
experiment.

The design of a controlled
experiment identifies how you
plan to manipulate the inde-
pendent variable, measure the
response of the dependent vari-
able, and control all the other
variables.

How does changing the concentra-
tion of hydrochloric acid affect the
time required for the acid to com-
pletely react with a fixed quantity
of zinc?

According to the collision–reaction
theory, if the concentration of
hydrochloric acid is increased, then
the time required for the reaction
with zinc will decrease. The rea-
soning that supports this prediction
is that a higher concentration of
HCl(aq) produces more collisions per
second between the aqueous ions
in hydrochloric acid and the zinc
atoms. More collisions per second
would produce more reactions per
second and, therefore, a shorter
time would be required to consume
the zinc.

The same amount of zinc metal is
made to react with different known
concentrations of excess hydrochloric
acid. The time for the zinc to com-
pletely react is measured for each
concentration of acid solution. The
independent variable is the concen-
tration of hydrochloric acid. The
dependent variable is the time for
the zinc to be consumed. The tem-
perature of the solution, the quan-
tity of zinc, the surface area of the
zinc in contact with the acid, and
the volume of the acid are all con-
trolled variables.

The collision–reaction theory
sounds logical. The purpose of this
investigation is to provide some
concrete evidence to support or
refute the collision–reaction theory.

Time to completion for the reaction
will be measured using a stop-
watch and recorded in a table like
Table 1.

The observations will be presented
in graphical format, with time on
the x-axis and concentration of
HCl(aq) on the y-axis. In this format
any trends or patterns will be
easier to see.

For a sample evaluation, see the
Lab Report in Appendix A4.

For the format of a typical lab
report, see the sample Lab Report
in Appendix A4.

There are many ways to gather
and record your observations
during your investigation. It is
helpful to plan ahead and think
about what data you will need
and how best to record them.
This helps to clarify your
thinking about the question
posed at the beginning, the
variables, the number of trials,
the procedure, the materials,
and your skills. It will also help
you organize your evidence for
easier analysis.

After thoroughly analyzing your
observations, you may have suf-
ficient and appropriate evi-
dence to enable you to answer
the question posed at the begin-
ning of the investigation.

At this stage of the investiga-
tion, you will evaluate the
processes that you followed to
plan and perform the investiga-
tion. Evaluating the processes
includes evaluating the mate-
rials, design, the procedure,
and your skills. You will also
evaluate the outcome of the
investigation, which involves
evaluating the hypothesis, i.e.,
whether the evidence supports
the hypothesis or not. You must
identify and take into account
any sources of error and uncer-
tainty in your measurements.
Compare the answer created in
the hypothesis/prediction with
the answer generated by ana-
lyzing the evidence. Is the
hypothesis acceptable or not?

In preparing your report, your
objectives should be to
describe your design and pro-
cedure accurately, and to report
your observations accurately
and honestly.

Correlational Studies

When the purpose of scientific inquiry is to test a suspected
relationship (hypothesis) between two different variables,
but a controlled experiment is not possible, a correlational
inquiry is conducted. In a correlational study, the investigator
tries to determine whether one variable is affecting another
without purposefully changing or controlling any of the vari-
ables. Instead, variables are allowed to change naturally. It is

often difficult to isolate cause and effect in correlational
studies. A correlational inquiry requires very large sample
numbers and many replications to increase the certainty of
the results.

The flow chart below outlines the components/processes
that are important in designing a correlational study. The
investigator can conduct the study without doing experi-
ments or fieldwork, for example, by using databases prepared

Choose a topic that interests
you. Determine whether you are
going to replicate or revise a
previous study, or create a new
one. Indicate your decision in a
statement of the purpose.

In planning a correlational
study, it is important to pose a
question about a possible sta-
tistical relationship between
variable A and variable B.

A hypothesis or prediction
would not be useful.
Correlational studies are not
intended to establish
cause–and–effect relationships.

The design of a correlational
study identifies how you will
gather data on the variables
under study and also identifies
potential sources. There are
two possible sources—
observation made by the inves-
tigator and existing data.

Is there a statistical relationship
between the acidity of the water in
an aquarium and the death of fish,
and if so, what is the relationship?

Does not apply. It is generally considered to be
unethical and inappropriate to con-
duct a controlled experiment in
which the pH is manipulated in
order to determine the acidity at
which most fish die. However, we
can obtain valuable data by
involving a large sample (N=100) of
home aquarium owners in a pH-
monitoring program. Aquarium
owners will measure the pH of
their aquariums at regular intervals
(every three days) over a period of
three months. They will note and
record the deaths of all fish.
Participants will be expected to
maintain their aquariums as they
normally would and will also be
asked to make other observations
(e.g., the species of dead fish,
symptoms leading up to the death)
during the study period.

The purpose of this investigation is
to determine whether there is a
relationship between aquarium
acidity and fish death and if so,
what the relationship is.

The results of the pH-monitoring
study will be recorded in a table
like Table 2. The pH will be meas-
ured and recorded every third cal-
endar day for three months.

We will analyze the data to deter-
mine if there is a relationship
between the pH and the number of
dead fish. We will also attempt to
determine whether the relationship
is statistically significant or is due
simply to chance.

The additional data will be ana-
lyzed to determine if some species
of fish are more affected by the
acidity level than others. The addi-
tional data will also be analyzed for
any warning signs that might alert
the owner to a potential problem.

In order to determine whether our
investigation provided valid evi-
dence to answer our question we
will need to ask several questions.
Is the sample size large enough to
enable us to generalize to the
larger population? Are we reason-
ably confident that the participants
measured the pH accurately and on
schedule?

If we are confident that the evi-
dence is reliable and valid, we may
be able to make recommendations
to aquarium owners to help them
prevent the death of their fish. The
investigation might lead us to con-
duct further studies or controlled
experiments, to answer such ques-
tions, as “Are there other factors
that are related to the death of
aquarium fish?”

For the format of a typical lab
report, see the sample Lab Report
in Appendix A4.

There are many ways to gather
and record your observations
during your investigation. It is
helpful to plan ahead and think
about what data you will need
and how best to record them.
This is an important step
because it helps to clarify your
thinking about the question
posed at the beginning, the
variables, the number of trials,
the procedure, the materials,
and your skills. It will also help
you organize your observations
for easier analysis.

After thoroughly analyzing your
observations, you may have suf-
ficient and appropriate evi-
dence to enable you to answer
the question posed at the
beginning of the investigation.

At this stage of the investiga-
tion, you will evaluate the
processes used to plan and per-
form the investigation.
Evaluating the processes
includes evaluating the mate-
rials, design, the procedure,
and your skills. 

In preparing your report, your
objectives should be to
describe your design and pro-
cedure accurately and to report
your observations accurately
and honestly.

more variables. The investigator can also make his or her own
observations and measurements through fieldwork, inter-

Even though the sequence is presented as linear, there are
normally many cycles through the steps during the actual 
study.

Observational Studies

Often the purpose of inquiry is simply to study a natural phe-
nomenon with the intention of gaining scientifically signifi-
cant information to answer a question. Observational studies
involve observing a subject or phenomenon in an unobtru-
sive or unstructured manner, often with no specific hypoth-
esis. A hypothesis to describe or explain the observations
may, however, be generated over time, and modified as new
information is collected.

The flow chart below summarizes the stages and
processes of scientific inquiry through observational studies.

Even though the sequence is presented as linear, there are
normally many cycles through the steps during the actual study.

Choose a topic that interests
you. Determine whether you are
going to replicate or revise a
previous study, or create a new
one. Indicate your decision in a
statement of the purpose.

In planning an observational
study, it is important to pose a
general question about the nat-
ural world. You may or may not
follow the question with the
creation of a hypothesis.

A hypothesis is a tentative
explanation. In an observational
study, a hypothesis can be
formed after observations have
been made and information has
been gathered on a topic. A
hypothesis may be created in
the analysis.

The design of an observational
study describes how you will
make observations relevant to
the question.

What common chemicals are found
in the local public swimming area
and in what concentrations are they
present?

At this point, we have no indication
of which chemicals are present in
the area, what their concentrations
may be, and if there are any threats
to swimmers. We have no hypoth-
esis and can make no predictions.

We will take a sample of water
from five different locations within
the local swimming area each week
for a month. Note will be made of
other significant conditions (e.g.,
heavy rain, wind) that are present
during the course of the study. The
water samples will be tested for
organic and inorganic chemicals
that may pose a health hazard. The
testing facilities at the Department
of Health and the Chemistry
Department at the local university
will be used to determine the pres-
ence and concentrations of chemi-
cals.

Although the bacterial quality of
public swimming areas is normally
tested by the municipal or provin-
cial Department of Health, no
chemical analysis is done unless a
problem arises. The purpose of this
investigation is to carry out an envi-
ronmental assessment to determine
the chemical quality of the local
public swimming area.

The data will be recorded in a table
like Table 3. The chemicals to be
tested for include the following:
—lead
—mercury
—cadmium
—nitrates/nitrites
—volatile organic compounds such

as benzene, toluene, carbon
tetrachloride

—petroleum products
—chlorine 

The concentrations of the chemi-
cals found in the swimming area
are determined.

We must determine if our sampling
and testing procedures are appro-
priate. Is the number of samples
sufficient? Were they taken at the
proper sites? Was the testing of
the samples carried out with care
and precision?

The presence of chemicals in
concentrations higher than the
acceptable levels will alert us to
potential problems with the swim-
ming site. This might suggest fur-
ther investigations to determine the
possible source(s) of the
chemical(s).

For the format of a typical lab
report, see the sample Lab Report
in Appendix A4.

There are many ways to gather
and record your observations
during your investigation.
During your observational
study, you should quantify your
observations where possible.
All observations should be
objective and unambiguous as
possible. Consider ways to
organize your information for
easier analysis.

After thoroughly analyzing your
observations, you may have suf-
ficient and appropriate evi-
dence to enable you to answer
the question posed at the begin-
ning of the investigation. You
may also have enough observa-
tions to form a hypothesis.

At this stage of the investiga-
tion, you will evaluate the
processes used to plan and per-
form the investigation.
Evaluating the processes
includes evaluating the mate-
rials, the design, the procedure,
and your skills. The results of
most such investigations will
suggest further studies, perhaps
correlational studies or con-
trolled experiments to explore
tentative hypotheses you may
have developed.

In preparing your report, your
objectives should be to
describe your design and pro-
cedure accurately, and to report
your observations accurately
and honestly.

612 Appendix A2

Modern life is filled with environmental and social issues that
have scientific and technological dimensions. An issue is
defined as a problem that has at least two possible solutions
rather than a single answer. There can be many positions,
generally determined by the values that an individual or a
society holds, on a single issue. Which solution is “best” is a
matter of opinion; ideally, the solution that is implemented is
the one that is most appropriate for society as a whole.

The common processes involved in the decision-making
process are outlined in the graphic below.

Even though the sequence is presented as linear, you may go
through several cycles before deciding you are ready to defend a
decision.

The first step in understanding an issue is to
explain why it is an issue, describe the problems
associated with the issue, and identify the individ-
uals or groups, called stakeholders, involved in the
issue. You could brainstorm the following questions
to research the issue: Who? What? Where? When?
Why? How? Develop background information on the
issue by clarifying facts and concepts, and identi-
fying relevant attributes, features, or characteristics
of the problem.

Examine the issue and think of as many
alternative solutions as you can. At this
point it does not matter if the solutions
seem unrealistic. To analyze the alterna-
tives, you should examine the issue from
a variety of perspectives. Stakeholders
may bring different viewpoints to an
issue and these may influence their
position on the issue. Brainstorm or
hypothesize how different stakeholders
would feel about your alternatives.
Perspectives that stakeholders may
adopt while approaching an issue are
listed in Table 2 (p. 614).

Formulate a research question that
helps to limit, narrow, or define the
issue. Then develop a plan to identify
and find reliable and relevant
sources of information. Outline the
stages of your information search:
gathering, sorting, evaluating,
selecting, and integrating relevant
information. You may consider using
a flow chart, concept map, or other
graphic organizer to outline the
stages of your information search.
Gather information from many
sources, including newspapers, mag-
azines, scientific journals, the
Internet, and the library.

One possible solution for people concerned
about pesticide use is to ban its production.
A solution for government might be to
enforce stricter regulations governing its use.

Think about how different stakeholders
might feel about the alternatives. For
example, citizens may be affected by the use
of pesticides in their neighbourhood. What
would be their perspective? What would be
the perspective of a parent of small children?
A farmer? A pest-control business owner? A
chemist? A gardener? Employees and owners
of the company that produces the pesticides?
An environmentalist? (See Table 1 for a start
on this process.) Remember that one person
can have more than one perspective. It is
also possible that two people, looking at an
issue from the same perspective, might dis-
agree about the best solution or even the
available information. For example, scientists
might disagree about the degree of risk asso-
ciated with pesticide use.

Begin your search for reliable and rele-
vant sources of information about the
issue with a question such as, “What
does the research say about the risk
associated with pesticide use?”, or
“What are the established positions of
various groups on the issue?” 

In recent years, the use of pesticides (herbicides, insecti-
cides, fungicides) on lawns has increased despite reports
of health and environmental risks. Several attempts are
being made to deal with the increased use, including pub-
licity campaigns by various groups, and attempts to ban or
limit use of pesticides at municipal and other government
levels. A list of possible stakeholders in this issue is
started in Table 1 (p. 614).

Develop background information on the issue by clari-
fying information and concepts, and identifying relevant
attributes, features, or characteristics of the problem, for
example:
• While more research is needed on the health risks,

many lawn chemicals currently in use are known car-
cinogens and there are numerous other less serious
symptoms (e.g., headaches, nausea, fever, breathing
difficulties) associated with pesticide poisoning.

• Manufacturers point out that the pesticides they manu-
facture have been approved for use by the federal gov-
ernment. Pesticides considered unsafe, such as DDT
and fenitrothion, have been banned.

Decision Making 



Decision Making 613

After reviewing government, chemical industry, and university
studies, and by reading newspaper articles and papers by
environmental groups, we concluded that research seems to
indicate that the active ingredients in many common pesti-
cides are carcinogenic and therefore pose a significant risk to
health.

There are reports that contradict our view, and domestic
pesticides have been approved for use by federal government
agencies. There are many jobs, some of them based in our
town, that rely on continued use of pesticides.

After performing a risk–benefit analysis of the various
alternative solutions, we decided that we should attempt to
reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides on lawns.

Table 3 (p. 615) shows a risk–benefit analysis of allowing
pesticide use on lawns.

In our defence at the town hall meeting,
we will concentrate on our evidence that
there are alternative methods of pest
control that are effective and safe. By
concentrating on this, and on reasonable
doubt about the safety of pesticide use,
we hope to be able to counter arguments
by opponents.

We tried to obtain information from a variety of
reputable sources; however, some of the
research is highly technical, and it is possible
that we misunderstood its main points or mis-
judged its relevance.

In the town hall meeting, we created a
bylaw to eliminate pesticide use on town prop-
erty and to limit use on private property to
exceptional circumstances. We realize that this
decision will not satisfy all stakeholders, but
we believe it is the best solution given the evi-
dence at our disposal.

This decision may cause painful changes in
industries that produce pesticides and for sev-
eral service industries. We believe that after a
transition period, these industries will survive
to produce and market safe alternatives to con-
ventional pesticides.

In this stage, you will analyze the issue and clarify
where you stand. First, you should establish criteria for
evaluating your information to determine its relevance
and significance. You can then evaluate your sources,
determine what assumptions may have been made, and
assess whether you have enough information to make
your decision.

Once the issue has been analyzed, you can begin to
evaluate the alternative solutions. You may decide to
carry out a risk–benefit analysis—a tool that enables
you to look at each possible result of a proposed action
and helps you make a decision. 

There are five steps that must be completed to effec-
tively analyze the issue:

1. Establish criteria for determining the relevance
and significance of the data you have gathered. 

2. Evaluate the sources of information. 

3. Identify and determine what assumptions have
been made. Challenge unsupported evidence.

4. Determine any causal, sequential, or structural
relationships associated with the issue. 

5. Evaluate the alternative solutions, possibly by con-
ducting a risk–benefit analysis. 

After analyzing your information, you
can answer your research question
and take an informed position on the
issue. You should be able to defend
your solution in an appropriate
format—debate, class discussion,
speech, position paper, multimedia
presentation (e.g., computer slide
show), brochure, poster, video.

Your position on the issue must be
justified using supporting information
that you have researched. You should
be able to defend your position to
people with different perspectives.
Ask yourself the following questions:
• Do I have supporting evidence

from a variety of sources?
• Can I state my position clearly?
• Can I show why this issue is rele-

vant and important to society?
• Do I have solid arguments (with

solid evidence) supporting my
position?

• Have I considered arguments
against my position, and identified
their faults?

• Have I analyzed the strong and
weak points of each perspective?

The final phase of decision making
includes evaluating the decision itself and
the process used to reach the decision.
After you have made a decision, carefully
examine the thinking that led to your deci-
sion. 

Some questions to guide your evalua-
tion include:
• What was my initial perspective on the

issue? How has my perspective
changed since I first began to explore
the issue?

• How did we make our decision? What
process did we use? What steps did we
follow?

• In what ways does our decision resolve
the issue?

• What are the likely short- and long-
term effects of the decision?

• To what extent am I satisfied with the
final decision?

• What reasons would I give to explain
our decision?

• If we had to make this decision again,
what would I do differently?

• Total the probability values of all the potential risks,
and all the potential benefits.

• Compare the sums to help you decide whether to accept
the proposed action.
Table 3 shows an incomplete risk–benefit analysis of one

option in the lawn pesticide issue—making no changes in
regulations. Note that although you should try to be objective
in your assessment, the beliefs of the person making the
risk–benefit analysis will have an effect on the final sums. The
possible outcomes considered for analysis, the assessment of
the relative importance of a cost or benefit, and the proba-
bility of the cost or benefit actually arising will vary according
to who does the analysis. For example, would you agree com-
pletely with the values placed in the “Cost” and “Benefit”
columns of the analysis in Table 3?

Decision Making 615

A Risk–Benefit Analysis Model
Risk–benefit analysis is a tool used to organize and analyze
information gathered in research. A thorough analysis of the
risks and benefits associated with each alternative solution
can help you decide on the best alternative.

• Research as many aspects of the proposal as possible.
Look at it from different perspectives.

• Collect as much evidence as you can, including reasonable
projections of likely outcomes if the proposal is adopted.

• Classify every individual potential result as being either
a benefit or a risk.

• Quantify the size of the potential benefit or risk (per-
haps as a dollar figure, or a number of lives affected, or
on a scale of 1 to 5).

• Estimate the probability (percentage) of that event
occurring.

• By multiplying the size of a benefit (or risk) by the
probability of its happening, you can calculate a proba-
bility value for each potential result.

616 Appendix A3

There is a difference between science and technology. The
goal of science is to understand the natural world. The goal of
technological problem solving is to develop or revise a
product or a process in response to a human need. The
product or process must fulfill its function but, in contrast
with scientific problem solving, it is not essential to under-

stand why or how it works. Technological solutions are eval-
uated based on such criteria as simplicity, reliability, effi-
ciency, cost, and ecological and political ramifications.

Even though the sequence presented in the graphic below is
linear, there are normally many cycles through the steps in any
problem-solving attempt.

This process involves recognizing and identi-
fying the need for a technological solution. You
need to clearly state the question(s) that you
want to investigate to solve the problem and
the criteria you will use as guidelines and to
evaluate your solution. In any design, some cri-
teria may be more important than others. For
example, if the product solution measures
accurately and is economical, but is not safe,
then it is clearly unacceptable.

Use your prior knowledge and
experience to propose possible
solutions. Creativity is also impor-
tant in suggesting novel solutions.

You should generate as many
ideas as possible about the func-
tioning of your solution and about
potential designs. During brain-
storming, the goal is to generate
many ideas without judging them.
They can be evaluated and
accepted or rejected later.

To visualize the possible solu-
tions it is helpful to draw
sketches. Sketches are often
better than verbal descriptions to
communicate an idea.

Planning is the heart of the entire process. Your
plan will outline your processes, identify potential
sources of information and materials, define your
resource parameters, and establish evaluation 
criteria.

Seven types of resources are generally used in
developing technological solutions to problems—
people, information, materials, tools, energy, cap-
ital, and time. 

Design 1: Poison Primrose Flower
Extract
Made by mixing dried and ground
poison primrose flower petals, boiling
the resulting powder in isopropyl
alcohol, and filtering the resulting
mixture to isolate the extract.

Design 2: Red Cabbage Extract
Made by mixing chopped up red cab-
bage with water in a blender and
straining the juice (extract) off from
the resulting mush.

People: The human resources required to solve this
problem include you and your partner.
Information: You already understand the concepts of
acidity and basicity. You will need to understand fully the
pH scale. You may also need to find out about naturally
occurring substances that react with acids or bases to
produce different (e.g., visible) effects.
Materials: Within the limitations imposed by your pro-
posed solution, cost, availability, safety, and time, you can
use whatever materials you deem necessary.
Tools: Your design should not require any specialized
tools or machines that are not immediately available.
Energy: The solution to this problem should not require
any external source of energy.
Capital: The dollar cost must be low. Your solution must
cost less to build than it would to buy a comparable com-
mercial product.
Time: Because of the time limit on the scientific investi-
gation, there is an even shorter time limit on the produc-
tion of the indicator. You should be able to produce your
indicator within 60 min. (This does not include designing
and testing.)

The solution will be evaluated on how well it meets
the design criteria established earlier.

We often need to solve technological problems
before we can conduct a scientific investigation. For
example, imagine that you are asked to conduct an
investigation in which you cannot, for safety rea-
sons, use the traditional, commercial pH indicators.
Your task, then, is to design a safe chemical indi-
cator for pH that will be as effective as those avail-
able commercially.

If you are not given criteria for the solution to the
problem (criteria are often given in technological
problem solving), you can establish your own by
asking some basic questions about the situation and
the function of the device. 

In this case, you are asked to design and produce
a chemical pH indicator to meet the following 
criteria:
• Must be able to measure pH to at least the

nearest 0.5 on the pH scale.
• Must be safe enough to pose no health hazard if

spilled on the skin or ingested.
• Must have a shelf life of at least one month.
• Must be at least as economical as a comparable

commercial product.
• Must be produced from readily available 

materials.

Technological Problem Solving



Technological Problem Solving 617

In this phase, you will construct and test your prototype using sys-
tematic trial and error. Try to manipulate only one variable at a time.
Use failures to inform the decisions you make before your next trial.
You may also complete a cost–benefit analysis on the prototype 

To help you decide on the best solution, you can rate each poten-
tial solution on each of the design criteria using a five-point rating
scale, with 1 being poor, 2 fair, 3 good, 4 very good, and 5 excellent.
You can then compare your proposed solutions by totalling the
scores.

Once you have made the choice among the possible solutions,
you need to produce and test a prototype. While making the proto-
type you may need to experiment with the characteristics of dif-
ferent components. A model, on a smaller scale, might help you
decide whether the product will be functional. The test of your pro-
totype should answer three basic questions:
• Does the prototype solve the problem?
• Does it satisfy the design criteria?
• Are there any unanticipated problems with the design?
If these questions cannot be answered satisfactorily, you may have
to modify the design or select another potential solution.

In presenting your solution, you
will communicate your solution,
identify potential applications,
and put your solution to use.

Once the prototype has been
produced and tested, the best
presentation of the solution is a
demonstration of its use—a test
under actual conditions. This
demonstration can also serve as
a further test of the design. Any
feedback should be considered
for future redesign. Remember
that no solution should be con-
sidered the absolute final solu-
tion.

The technological problem-
solving process is cyclical. At
this stage, evaluating your solu-
tion and the process you used to
arrive at your solution may lead
to a revision of the solution.

Evaluation is not restricted to
the final step, however, it is
important to evaluate the final
product using the criteria estab-
lished earlier, and to evaluate
the processes used while
arriving at the solution. Consider
the following questions:
• To what degree does the final

product meet the design cri-
teria?

• Did you have to make any com-
promises in the design? If so,
are there ways to minimize the
effects of the compromises?

• Did you exceed any of the
resource parameters?

• Are there other possible solu-
tions that deserve future con-
sideration?

• How did your group work as a
team?

The chosen design was presented to
the chemistry class. A set of 12 test
tubes was set up. Each tube con-
tained a colourless solution of known
pH, ranging from pH 1 to pH 14. Ten
drops of red cabbage extract was
added to each of the tubes.
Students observed the colour
changes and rated the results using
a rating scale similar to the one
used in the product testing stages.
Students were given a list of the cri-
teria used in the design and produc-
tion stages, and were asked to
provide comments regarding the
indicator’s performance.

Our chosen product, red cabbage
extract, meets most of the established
criteria. Feedback from the chemistry
class demonstration was positive.
Unfortunately, the indicator does not
change colour in the intervals pH 3 to
4 and pH 9 to 10, which limits how it
can be used.

Kept in the refrigerator, red cab-
bage extract is still acting as a good
pH indicator one month after it was
prepared. Red cabbage is readily
available. Its extract is safe for all
uses and cheap to prepare.

In general, our group worked well
as a team. However, some individuals
pitched in a little more than others,
especially in areas where they felt
they they were more skilled. We have
agreed that in future projects, every
member of the team will work on
something that is new to them, which
will give each of us a chance to learn,
and everyone will do their fair share
in the final cleanup.

Table 1 illustrates the rating for two different designs. Note that
although Design 1 came out with the highest rating, there is one factor
(safety) that suggests that we should go with Design 2. This is what is
referred to as a tradeoff. By reviewing or evaluating product and processes,
we may be able to modify Design 2 to optimize its performance on the other
criteria.

When carrying out investigations, it is important that scien-
tists keep records of their plans and results, and share their
findings. In order to have their investigations repeated (repli-
cated) and accepted by the scientific community, scientists
generally share their work by publishing papers in which
details of their design, materials, procedure, evidence,
analysis, and evaluation are given.

Lab reports are prepared after an investigation is com-
pleted. To ensure that you can accurately describe the inves-
tigation, it is important to keep thorough and accurate
records of your activities as you carry out the investigation.

Investigators use a similar format in their final reports or
lab books, although the headings and order may vary. Your
lab book or report should reflect the type of scientific inquiry
that you used in the investigation and should be based on the
following headings, as appropriate. (See Figure 1 for a sample
lab report.)

Title

At the beginning of your report, write the number and title of
your investigation. In this course the title is usually given, but
if you are designing your own investigation, create a title that
suggests what the investigation is about. Include the date the
investigation was conducted and the names of all lab partners
(if you worked as a team).

Purpose

State the purpose of the investigation. Why are you doing this
investigation?

Question

This is the question that you attempted to answer in the
investigation. If it is appropriate to do so, state the question
in terms of independent and dependent variables.

Hypothesis/Prediction

Based on your reasoning or on a concept that you have
studied, formulate an explanation of what should happen (a
hypothesis). From your hypothesis you may make a predic-
tion, a statement of what you expect to observe, before car-
rying out the investigation. Depending on the nature of your
investigation, you may or may not have a hypothesis or a 
prediction.

Design

This is a brief general overview (one to three sentences) of
what was done. If your investigation involved independent,
dependent, and controlled variables, list them. Identify any
control or control group that was used in the investigation.

Materials

This is a detailed list of all materials used, including sizes and
quantities where appropriate. Be sure to include safety equip-
ment such as goggles, lab apron, latex gloves, and tongs,
where needed. Draw a diagram to show any complicated
setup of apparatus.

Procedure

Describe, in detailed, numbered, step-by-step format, the
procedure you followed in carrying out your investigation.
Include steps to clean up and dispose of waste.

Observations

This includes all qualitative and quantitative observations
that you made. Be as precise as appropriate when describing
quantitative observations, include any unexpected observa-
tions, and present your information in a form that is easily
understood. If you have only a few observations, this could be
a list; for controlled experiments and for many observations,
a table will be more appropriate.

Analysis

Interpret your observations and present the evidence in the
form of tables, graphs, or illustrations, each with a title.
Include any calculations, the results of which can be shown in
a table. Make statements about any patterns or trends you
observed. Conclude the analysis with a statement based only
on the evidence you have gathered, answering the question
that initiated the investigation.

Evaluation

The evaluation is your judgment about the quality of evi-
dence obtained and about the validity of the prediction and
hypothesis (if present). This section can be divided into two
parts:

• Did your observations provide reliable and valid evi-
dence to enable you to answer the question? Are you
confident enough in the evidence to use it to evaluate
any prediction and/or hypothesis you made?

• Was the prediction you made before the investigation
supported or falsified by the evidence? Based on your
evaluation of the evidence or prediction, is the hypoth-
esis supported or should it be rejected?

Investigation 2.5 – The Effect 
of Concentration on Reaction Time

Conducted: December 15, 2001

By: Barry L. and Lakshmi B.

Purpose

The purpose of this investigation is to test one of the ideas of the collision–reaction theory.

Question

How does changing the concentration of hydrochloric acid affect the time required for the reaction of
hydrochloric acid with a fixed quantity of zinc?

Hypothesis/Prediction

According to the collision–reaction theory, if the concentration of hydrochloric acid is increased, then
the time required for the reaction with zinc will decrease. The reasoning that supports this hypothesis
is that a higher concentration produces more collisions per second between the hydrochloric acid par-
ticles and the zinc atoms. More collisions per second would produce more reactions per second and
therefore, a shorter time required to consume the zinc.

Experimental Design

Different known concentrations of excess hydrochloric acid react with zinc metal. The time for the zinc
to completely react is measured for each concentration of acid solution. The independent variable is the
concentration of hydrochloric acid. The dependent variable is the time for the zinc to be consumed. The
temperature of the solution, the quantity of zinc, the surface area of the zinc in contact with the acid,
and the volume of the acid are all controlled variables.

Materials

lab apron safety glasses
four 10-mL graduated cylinders four 18 × 150-mm test tubes and test-tube rack
clock or watch (precise to nearest second) four pieces of zinc metal strip, 5 mm × 5 mm
stock solutions of HCl(aq): 2.0 mol/L, a solution of a weak base (baking soda)

1.5 mol/L, 1.0 mol/L, 0.5 mol/L

Procedure

1. 15 mL of 2.0 mol/L HCl(aq) was transferred into an 18 × 150-mm test tube.
2. A piece of Zn(s) was carefully placed into the hydrochloric acid solution. The starting time of the

reaction was noted.

3. The time required for all of the zinc to react was measured and recorded.

4. Steps 2 to 4 were repeated using 1.5 mol/L, 1.0 mol/L, 0.5 mol/L HCl(aq).

5. Any acid remaining in the solutions was neutralized with a solution of the weak base and then
poured down the sink with large amounts of water.

Figure 1 

Sample Lab Report



620 Appendix A4

Appendix A4

Observations

Analysis

The evidence is plotted on a graph of time vs. concentration of HCl(aq) (below). The graph tends to level
off at the two highest concentrations. From this trend we can predict, both from the graph and from
common sense, that if you keep increasing the concentration, the reaction time will never reach zero.
We might also predict that as
the concentration gets very
low, the time required for all
of the zinc to react will
become very long.

Based on the evidence
gathered in this investigation,
increasing the concentration
of hydrochloric acid decreases
the time required for the reac-
tion of hydrochloric acid with
a fixed quantity of zinc.

Evaluation

The design, materials, and skills used in this investigation are adequate because this experiment pro-
duced the type of evidence needed to answer the question with a high degree of certainty. The variables
were easy to measure, manipulate, and control.

The procedure is also considered to be adequate since the steps are simple and straightforward. We
could have improved the procedure by extending the range of concentrations, by stirring, and by per-
forming more than one trial for each concentration.

Sources of uncertainty in this investigation include the purity of the zinc metal strip, the concen-
tration of the stock acid, and the determination of when the last bit of zinc had reacted.

The hypothesis is supported by the evidence, which clearly shows that the reaction time decreased
as the concentration increased. Based on the evidence, the collision–reaction theory is also acceptable.

Synthesis

Other investigations using one of the controlled variables (e.g., temperature of the acid, surface area of
the zinc) as the independent variable could be carried out to determine their effect on the reaction rate.
Additional investigations studying the effect of concentration on reaction rate using different reactants
and reaction types could be conducted.

Scientific Notation
It is difficult to work with very large or very small numbers
when they are written in common decimal notation. Usually
it is possible to accommodate such numbers by changing the
SI prefix so that the number falls between 0.1 and 1000; for
example, 237 000 000 mm can be expressed as 237 km 
and 0.000 000 895 kg can be expressed as 0.895 mg. However,
this prefix change is not always possible, either because an
appropriate prefix does not exist or because it is essential to
use a particular unit of measurement. In these cases, the best
method of dealing with very large and very small numbers is
to write them using scientific notation. Scientific notation
expresses a number by writing it in the form a × 10n, where 
1 < |a| < 10 and the digits in the coefficient a are all signifi-
cant. Table 1 shows situations where scientific notation
would be used.

To multiply numbers in scientific notation, multiply the coef-
ficients and add the exponents; the answer is expressed in sci-
entific notation. Note that when writing a number in
scientific notation, the coefficient should be between 1 and
10 and should be rounded to the same certainty (number of
significant digits) as the measurement with the least certainty
(fewest number of significant digits). Look at the following
examples:

(4.73 × 105 m)(5.82 × 107 m) = 27.5 × 1012 m2 = 2.75 × 1013 m2

(3.9 × 104 N)(5.3 × 10–3 m) = 0.74 × 107 N•m = 7.4 × 106 N•m

On many calculators, scientific notation is entered using a
special key, labelled EXP or EE. This key includes “× 10” from
the scientific notation; you need to enter only the exponent.
For example, to enter

7.5 × 104 press 7.5 EXP 4
3.6 × 10–3 press 3.6 EXP +/–3

Uncertainty in Measurements
There are two types of quantities that are used in science:
exact values and measurements. Exact values include defined
quantities (1 m = 100 cm) and counted values (5 cars in a
parking lot). Measurements, however, are not exact because
there is some uncertainty or error associated with every
measurement.

There are two types of measurement error. Random
error results when an estimate is made to obtain the last sig-
nificant figure for any measurement. The size of the random
error is determined by the precision of the measuring instru-
ment. For example, when measuring length, it is necessary to
estimate between the marks on the measuring tape. If these
marks are 1 cm apart, the random error will be greater and
the precision will be less than if the marks are 1 mm apart.

Systematic error is associated with an inherent problem
with the measuring system, such as the presence of an inter-
fering substance, incorrect calibration, or room conditions.
For example, if the balance is not zeroed at the beginning, all
measurements will have a systematic error; if using a metre
stick that has been worn slightly, all measurements will con-
tain an error.

The precision of measurements depends upon the gra-
dations of the measuring device. Precision is the place value
of the last measurable digit. For example, a measurement of
12.74 cm is more precise than a measurement of 127.4 cm
because the first value was measured to hundredths of a cen-
timetre whereas the latter was measured to tenths of a 
centimetre.

When adding or subtracting measurements of different
precision, the answer is rounded to the same precision as the
least precise measurement. For example, using a calculator,
add

11.7 cm + 3.29 cm + 0.542 cm = 15.532 cm 

The answer must be rounded to 15.5 cm because the first
measurement limits the precision to a tenth of a centimetre.

No matter how precise a measurement is, it still may not
be accurate. Accuracy refers to how close a value is to its true
value. The comparison of the two values can be expressed as
a percentage difference. The percentage difference is calcu-
lated as:

% difference = × 100
�experimental value – predicted value�
����

predicted value

622 Appendix A5

Figure 1 shows an analogy between precision and accuracy,
and the positions of darts thrown at a dartboard.

How certain you are about a measurement depends on two
factors: the precision of the instrument used and the size  of the
measured quantity. More precise instruments give more certain
values. For example, a mass measurement of 13 g is less precise than
a measurement of 12.76 g; you are more certain about the second
measurement than the first. Certainty also depends on the meas-
urement. For example, consider the measurements 0.4 cm and 15.9
cm;both have the same precision.However, if the measuring instru-
ment is precise to ± 0.1 cm, the first measurement is 0.4 ± 0.1 cm 
(0.3 cm or 0.5 cm) or an error of 25%, whereas the second meas-
urement could be 15.9 ± 0.1 cm (15.8 cm or 16.0 cm) for an error
of 0.6%.For both factors—the precision of the instrument used and
the value of the measured quantity—the more digits there are in a
measurement, the more certain you are about the measurement.

Significant Digits

The certainty of any measurement is communicated by the
number of significant digits in the measurement. In a meas-
ured or calculated value, significant digits are the digits that are
certain plus one estimated (uncertain) digit. Significant digits
include all digits correctly reported from a measurement.

Follow these rules to decide if a digit is significant:

1. If a decimal point is present, zeros to the left of the first
non-zero digit (leading zeros) are not significant.

2. If a decimal point is not present, zeros to the right of the
last non-zero digit (trailing zeros) are not significant.

3. All other digits are significant.

4. When a measurement is written in scientific notation, all
digits in the coefficient are significant.

5. Counted and defined values have infinite significant digits.

Table 2 shows some examples of significant digits.
An answer obtained by multiplying and/or dividing

measurements is rounded to the same number of significant
digits as the measurement with the fewest number of signifi-

cant digits. For example, if we use a calculator to solve the fol-
lowing equation:

77.8 km/h × 0.8967 h = 69.76326 km 

However, the certainty of the answer is limited to three sig-
nificant digits, so the answer is rounded up to 69.8 km.

Rounding Off

The following rules should be used when rounding answers
to calculations.

1. When the first digit discarded is less than five, the last
digit retained should not be changed.
3.141 326 rounded to 4 digits is 3.141

2. When the first digit discarded is greater than five, or if
it is a five followed by at least one digit other than zero,
the last digit retained is increased by 1 unit.
2.221 672 rounded to 4 digits is 2.222
4.168 501 rounded to 4 digits is 4.169

3. When the first digit discarded is five followed by only
zeros, the last digit retained is increased by 1 if it is odd,
but not changed if it is even.
2.35 rounded to 2 digits is 2.4
2.45 rounded to 2 digits is 2.4
–6.35 rounded to 2 digits is –6.4

Measuring and Estimating

Many people believe that all measurements are reliable (con-
sistent over many trials), precise (to as many decimal places as
possible), and accurate (representing the actual value). But
there are many things that can go wrong when measuring.

• There may be limitations that make the instrument or
its use unreliable (inconsistent).

• The investigator may make a mistake or fail to follow
the correct techniques when reading the measurement
to the available precision (number of decimal places).

• The instrument may be faulty or inaccurate; a similar
instrument may give different readings.

For example, when measuring the temperature of a liquid, it
is important to keep the thermometer at the correct depth
and the bulb of the thermometer away from the bottom and
sides of the container. If you set a thermometer with its bulb
on the bottom of a liquid-filled container, you will be meas-
uring the temperature of the bottom of the container, and
not the temperature of the liquid. There are similar concerns
with other measurements.

To be sure that you have measured correctly, you should
repeat your measurements at least three times. If your meas-
urements appear to be reliable, calculate the mean and use
that value. To be more certain about the accuracy, repeat the
measurements with a different instrument.

Logarithms
Any positive number N can be expressed as a power of some
base b where b > 1. Some obvious examples are:

16 = 24 base 2, exponent 4

25 = 52 base 5, exponent 2

27 = 33 base 3, exponent 3

0.001 = 10–3 base 10, exponent –3

In each of these examples, the exponent is an integer; how-
ever, exponents may be any real number, not just an integer.
If you use the xy button on your calculator, you can experi-
ment to obtain a better understanding of this concept.

The most common base is base 10. Some examples for
base 10 are

100.5 = 3.162

101.3 = 19.95

10�2.7 = 0.001995

By definition, the exponent to which a base b must be raised
to produce a given number N is called the logarithm of N to
base b (abbreviated as logb). When the value of the base is not
written, it is assumed to be base 10. Logarithms to base 10 are
called common logarithms. We can express the previous
examples as logarithms:

log 3.162 = 0.5

log 19.95 = 1.3

log 0.001995 = –2.7

Most measurement scales you have encountered are
linear in nature. For example, a speed of 80 km/h is twice as
fast as a speed of 40 km/h and four times as fast as a speed of
20 km/h. However, there are several examples in science
where the range of values of the variable being measured is so
great that it is more convenient to use a logarithmic scale to
base 10. One example of this is the scale for measuring the
acidity of a solution (the pH scale). For example, a solution
with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a solution with a
pH of 4 and 100 times (102) more acidic than a solution with
a pH of 5. Other situations that use logarithmic scales are
sound intensity (the dB scale) and the intensity of earth-
quakes (the Richter scale).

Safety Conventions and Symbols

Although every effort is undertaken to make the science
experience a safe one, there are inherent risks associated with
some scientific investigations. These risks are generally asso-
ciated with the materials and equipment used, and the disre-
gard of safety instructions that accompany investigations.
However, there may also be risks associated with the location
of the investigation, whether in the science laboratory, at
home, or outdoors. Most of these risks pose no more danger
than one would normally experience in everyday life. With an
awareness of the possible hazards, knowledge of the rules,
appropriate behaviour, and a little common sense, these risks
can be practically eliminated.

Remember, you share the responsibility not only for your
own safety, but also for the safety of those around you.
Always alert the teacher in case of an accident.

In this text, chemicals, equipment, and procedures that
are hazardous are highlighted in red and are preceded by the
appropriate Workplace Hazardous Materials Information
System (WHMIS) symbol or by            .

WHMIS Symbols and HHPS

The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System
(WHMIS) provides workers and students with complete and
accurate information regarding hazardous products. All
chemical products supplied to schools, businesses, and
industries must contain standardized labels and be accompa-
nied by Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) providing
detailed information about the product. Clear and standard-
ized labelling is an important component of WHMIS (Table
1). These labels must be present on the product’s original
container or be added to other containers if the product is
transferred.

The Canadian Hazardous Products Act requires manu-
facturers of consumer products containing chemicals to
include a symbol specifying both the nature of the primary
hazard and the degree of this hazard. In addition, any sec-
ondary hazards, first aid treatment, storage, and disposal
must be noted. Household Hazardous Product Symbols
(HHPS) are used to show the hazard and the degree of the
hazard by the type of border surrounding the illustration
(Figure 1).

Safety in the Laboratory

General Safety Rules

Safety in the laboratory is an attitude and a habit more than
it is a set of rules. It is easier to prevent accidents than to deal
with the consequences of an accident. Most of the following
rules are common sense.

• Do not enter a laboratory or prep room unless a teacher
or other supervisor is present, or you have permission
to do so.

• Familiarize yourself with your school’s safety regulations.
• Make your teacher aware of any allergies or other health

problems you may have.
• Listen carefully to any instructions given by your

teacher, and follow them closely.
• Wear eye protection, lab aprons or coats, and protective

gloves when appropriate.
• Wear closed shoes (not sandals) when working in the

laboratory.
• Place your books and bags away from the work area.

Keep your work area clear of all materials except those
that you will use in the investigation.

• Do not chew gum, eat, or drink in the laboratory. Food
should not be stored in refrigerators in laboratories.

• Know the location of MSDS information, exits, and all
safety equipment, such as the fire blanket, fire extin-
guisher, and eyewash station.

• Use stands, clamps, and holders to secure any poten-
tially dangerous or fragile equipment that could be
tipped over.

• Avoid sudden or rapid motion in the laboratory that
may interfere with someone carrying or working with
chemicals or using sharp instruments.

• Never engage in horseplay or practical jokes in the 
laboratory.

• Ask for assistance when you are not sure how to do a
procedural step.

• Never attempt unauthorized experiments.
• Never work in a crowded area or alone in the laboratory.
• Report all accidents.
• Clean up all spills, even spills of water, immediately.
• Always wash your hands with soap and water before or

immediately after you leave the laboratory. Wash your
hands before you touch any food.

• Do not forget safety procedures when you leave the lab-
oratory. Accidents can also occur outdoors, at home, or
at work.

Eye and Face Safety

• Wear approved eye protection in a laboratory, no
matter how simple or safe the task appears to be. Keep
the eye protection over your eyes, not on top of your

head. For certain experiments, full face protection
(safety goggles or a face shield) may be necessary.

• Never look directly into the opening of flasks or test
tubes.

• If, in spite of all precautions, you get a chemical in your
eye, quickly use the eyewash or nearest cold running
water. Continue to rinse the eye with water for at least
15 min. This is a very long time—have someone time
you. Have another student inform your teacher of the
accident. The injured eye should be examined by a
doctor.

• If you must wear contact lenses in the laboratory, be
extra careful; whether or not you wear contact lenses,
do not touch your eyes without first washing your
hands. If you do wear contact lenses, make sure that
your teacher is aware of it. Carry your lens case and a
pair of glasses with you.

• If a piece of glass or other foreign object enters your
eye, seek immediate medical attention.

• Do not stare directly at any bright source of light (e.g.,
a piece of burning magnesium ribbon, lasers, or the
Sun). You will not feel any pain if your retina is being
damaged by intense radiation. You cannot rely on the
sensation of pain to protect you.

• When working with lasers, be aware that a reflected
laser beam can act like a direct beam on the eye.

Handling Glassware Safely

• Never use glassware that is cracked or chipped. Give
such glassware to your teacher or dispose of it as
directed. Do not put the item back into circulation.

• Never pick up broken glassware with your fingers. Use a
broom and dustpan.

• Do not put broken glassware into garbage containers.
Dispose of glass fragments in special containers marked
“Broken Glass.”

• Heat glassware only if it is approved for heating. Check
with your teacher before heating any glassware.

• If you cut yourself, inform your teacher immediately.
Embedded glass or continued bleeding requires medical
attention.

• If you need to insert glass tubing or a thermometer into
a rubber stopper, get a cork borer of a suitable size.
Insert the borer in the hole of the rubber stopper,
starting from the small end of the stopper. Once the
borer is pushed all the way through the hole, insert the
tubing or thermometer through the borer. Ease the
borer out of the hole, leaving the tubing or ther-
mometer inside. To remove the tubing or thermometer
from the stopper, push the borer from the small end

• Keep a clear workplace when performing experiments
with heat.

• When heating a test tube over a laboratory burner, use a
test-tube holder and a spurt cap. Holding the test tube
at an angle, facing away from you and others, gently
move the test tube backwards and forwards through the
flame.

• Remember to include a “cooling” time in your experi-
ment plan; do not put away hot equipment.

• Very small fires in a container may be extinguished by
covering the container with a wet paper towel or
ceramic square.

• For larger fires, inform the teacher and follow the
teacher’s instructions for using fire extinguishers, blan-
kets, alarms, and for evacuation. Do not attempt to deal
with a fire by yourself.

• If anyone’s clothes or hair catch fire, tell the person to
drop to the floor and roll. Then use a fire blanket to
help smother the flames.

Electrical Safety

• Water or wet hands should never be used near electrical
equipment.

• Do not operate electrical equipment near running water
or any large containers of water.

• Check the condition of electrical equipment. Do not
use if wires or plugs are damaged, or if the ground pin
has been removed.

• Make sure that electrical cords are not placed where
someone could trip over them.

• When unplugging equipment, remove the plug gently
from the socket. Do not pull on the cord.

• When using variable power supplies, start at low voltage
and increase slowly.

Handling Chemicals Safely

Many chemicals are hazardous to some degree. When using
chemicals, operate under the following principles:

1. Never underestimate the risks associated with chemi-
cals. Assume that any unknown chemicals are 
hazardous.

2. If you can substitute, use a less hazardous chemical
wherever possible.

3. Reduce exposure to chemicals to the absolute min-
imum. Avoid direct skin contact if possible.

4. When using chemicals, ensure that there is adequate
ventilation.

through the stopper until it shows from the other end.
Ease the tubing or thermometer out of the borer.

• Protect your hands with heavy gloves or several layers of
cloth before inserting glass into rubber stoppers.

• Be very careful while cleaning glassware. There is an
increased risk of breakage from dropping when the
glassware is wet and slippery.

Using Sharp Instruments Safely

• Make sure your instruments are sharp. Surprisingly, one
of the main causes of accidents with cutting instru-
ments is the use of a dull instrument. Dull cutting
instruments require more pressure than sharp instru-
ments and are therefore much more likely to slip.

• Select the appropriate instrument for the task. Never
use a knife when scissors would work better.

• Always cut away from yourself and others.
• If you cut yourself, inform your teacher immediately

and get appropriate first aid.
• Be careful when working with wire cutters or wood

saws. Use a cutting board where needed.

Heat and Fire Safety

• In a laboratory where burners or hot plates are being
used, never pick up a glass object without first checking
the temperature by lightly and quickly touching the
item, or by placing your hand near, but not on, the
item. Glass items that have been heated stay hot for a
long time, but do not appear to be hot. Metal items
such as ring stands and hot plates can also cause burns;
take care when touching them.

• Do not use a laboratory burner near wooden shelves,
flammable liquids, or any other item that is 
combustible.

• Before using a laboratory burner, make sure that long
hair is tied back. Do not wear loose clothing (wide long
sleeves should be tied back or rolled up).

• Never look down the barrel of a laboratory burner.
• Always pick up a burner by the base, never by the

barrel.
• Never leave a lighted laboratory burner unattended.
• If you burn yourself, immediately run cold water gently

over the burned area or immerse the burned area in
cold water and inform your teacher.

• Make sure that heating equipment, such as a burner,
hot plate, or electrical equipment, is secure on the
bench and clamped in place when necessary.

• Always assume that hot plates and electric heaters are
hot and use protective gloves when handling.



628 Appendix B2

The following guidelines do not address every possible situa-
tion but, used with common sense, are appropriate for situa-
tions in the high-school laboratory.

• Consult the MSDS before you use a chemical.
• Appropriate eye protection must be worn at all times

where chemicals are used or stored. Wear a lab coat
and/or other protective clothing (e.g., aprons, gloves).

• When carrying chemicals, hold containers carefully
using two hands, one around the container and one
underneath.

• Read all labels to ensure that the chemicals you have
selected are the intended ones. Never use the contents
of a container that has no label or has an illegible label.
Give any such containers to your teacher.

• Label all chemical containers correctly to avoid confu-
sion about contents.

• Never pipet or start a siphon by mouth. Use a pipet
bulb or equivalent device.

• Pour liquid chemicals carefully (down the side of the
receiving container or down a stirring rod) to ensure
that they do not splash. Always pour from the side
opposite the label—if everyone follows this rule, drips
will always form on the same side, away from your
hand.

• Always pour volatile chemicals in a fume hood or in a
well-ventilated area.

• Never smell or taste chemicals.
• Return chemicals to their correct storage place.

Chemicals are stored by hazard class.
• If you spill a chemical, use a chemical spill kit to clean

up.
• Do not return surplus chemicals to stock bottles.

Dispose of excess chemicals in the appropriate manner.
• Clean up your work area, the fume hood, and any other

area where chemicals were used.
• Wash hands immediately after handling chemicals and

before leaving the lab, even if you wore gloves.

Waste Disposal

Waste disposal at school, at home, or at work is a social and
environmental issue. To protect the environment, federal and
provincial governments have regulations to control wastes,
especially chemical wastes. For example, the WHMIS pro-
gram applies to controlled products that are being handled.
(When being transported, they are regulated under the
Transport of Dangerous Goods Act, and for disposal they are

subject to federal, provincial, and municipal regulations.)
Most laboratory waste can be washed down the drain, or, if it
is in solid form, placed in ordinary garbage containers.
However, some waste must be treated more carefully. It is
your responsibility to follow procedures and dispose of waste
in the safest possible manner according to the teacher’s
instructions.

Flammable Substances

Flammable liquids should not be washed down the drain.
Special fire-resistant containers are used to store flammable
liquid waste. Waste solids that pose a fire hazard should be
stored in fireproof containers. Care must be taken not to
allow flammable waste to come into contact with any sparks,
flames, other ignition sources, or oxidizing materials. The
method of disposal depends on the nature of the substance.

Corrosive Solutions

Solutions that are corrosive but not toxic, such as acids and
bases, can usually be washed down the drain, but care should
be taken to ensure that they are first either neutralized or
diluted to low concentration. While disposing of such sub-
stances, use large quantities of water and continue to pour
water down the drain for a few minutes after all the substance
has been washed away.

Heavy Metal Solutions

Heavy metal compounds (for example, lead, mercury, and
cadmium compounds) should not be flushed down the
drain. These substances are cumulative poisons and should
be kept out of the environment. Pour any heavy metal waste
into the special container marked “Heavy Metal Waste.”
Remember that paper towels used to wipe up solutions of
heavy metals, as well as filter papers with heavy metal com-
pounds embedded in them, should be treated as solid toxic
waste.

Disposal of heavy metal solutions is usually accomplished
by precipitating the metal ion (for example, as lead (II) sili-
cate) and disposing of the solid. Heavy metal compounds
should not be placed in school garbage containers. Usually,
waste disposal companies collect materials that require spe-
cial disposal and dispose of them as required by law.

Toxic Substances

Toxic chemicals and solutions of toxic substances should not
be poured down the drain. They should be retained for dis-
posal by a licensed waste disposal company.

• If you have ingested or inhaled a hazardous substance,
inform your teacher immediately. The MSDS will give
information about the first-aid requirements for the
substance in question. Contact the Poison Control
Centre in your area.

• If the injury is from a burn, immediately immerse the
affected area in cold water. This will reduce the temper-
ature and prevent further tissue damage.

• In the event of electrical shock, do not touch the
affected person or the equipment the person was using.
Break contact by switching off the source of electricity
or by removing the plug.

• If a classmate’s injury has rendered him/her uncon-
scious, notify the teacher immediately. The teacher will
perform CPR if necessary. Do not administer CPR
unless under specific instructions from the teacher. You
can assist by keeping the person warm and reassured.

Organic Material

Remains of plants and animals can generally be disposed of
in the normal school garbage containers. Animal dissection
specimens should be rinsed thoroughly to rid them of any
excess preservative and sealed in plastic bags.

Fungi and bacterial cultures should be autoclaved or
treated with a fungicide or antibacterial soap before disposal.

First Aid

The following guidelines apply if an injury, such as a burn,
cut, chemical spill, ingestion, inhalation, or splash in eyes,
happens to yourself or to one of your classmates.

• If an injury occurs, inform your teacher immediately.
• Know the location of the first-aid kit, fire blanket, eye-

wash station, and shower, and be familiar with the con-
tents/operation.

• If the injury is the result of chemicals, drench the
affected area with a continuous flow of water for 30 min.
Clothing should be removed as necessary. Inform your
teacher. Retrieve the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
for the chemical; this sheet provides information about
the first-aid requirements for the chemical. If the chemi-
cals are splashed in your eyes, have another student
assist you in getting to the eyewash station immediately.
Rinse with the eyes open for at least 15 min.

646 Glossary

spectator: an entity or substance, such as an ion, molecule, or
ionic solid, that does not change or take part in a chemical
reaction

stable octet: a full shell of eight electrons in the outer energy
level of an atom

standard curve: a graph used for reference, plotted with
empirical data obtained using known standards

standard solution: a solution for which the precise concentra-
tion is known

stock solution: a solution that is in stock or on the shelf (i.e.,
available); usually a concentrated (possibly even saturated)
solution

stoichiometric: involving a single, whole-number ratio of ions,
as in a balanced chemical equation

stoichiometry: the study of the relationships between the
quantities of reactants and products involved in chemical reac-
tions

STP (standard temperature and pressure): exactly 0°C and
101.325 kPa

strong acid: an acid that ionizes almost completely (>99%) in
water to form aqueous hydrogen ions (theoretical definition)

strong base: an ionic hydroxide that dissociates 100% in water
to produce hydroxide ions (according to Arrhenius’ theory and
the “reaction-with-water” theory)

structural formula: a representation of the number, types, and
arrangement of atoms in a molecule, with dashes representing
covalent bonds

structural isomers: chemicals with the same molecular for-
mula, but with different structures and different names

synthesis reaction: a chemical reaction in which two or more
simple substances combine to form a more complex substance;
also known as a combination reaction

temperature: a measure of the average kinetic energy of a sub-
stance’s particles; represented by t, when using degrees Celsius

tertiary compound: a compound composed of three different
elements

theoretical knowledge: knowledge based on abstract ideas cre-
ated to explain observations

theoretical yield: the amount of product that we predict will
be obtained, calculated from the equation

theory: a comprehensive set of ideas that explains a law or a
large number of related observations

thermal decomposition: a decomposition reaction that occurs
when the reactant is heated

thermochemical equation: a balanced chemical equation that
includes the heat transferred to or from the surroundings

titrant: the solution in the buret during a titration

titration: a laboratory procedure involving the carefully meas-
ured and controlled addition of a solution from a buret into a

T

measured volume of a sample solution

total ionic equation: a chemical equation that shows all high-
solubility ionic compounds in their dissociated form

transition: movement of an electron from one energy level to
another (theoretical definition)

transition metal: an element in Groups 3 through 12 of the
periodic table

transmutation: the changing of one element into another as a
result of radioactive decay

transuranic elements: elements that follow uranium in the
periodic table, elements 93+

trend: a gradual and consistent change in properties within
periods or groups of the periodic table

triad: a group of three elements with similar properties

unified atomic mass unit: a unit of mass for atoms; 1/12 of the
mass of a carbon-12 atom (theoretical definition); represented
by u

unsaturated hydrocarbon: a reactive hydrocarbon whose mol-
ecules contain double and triple covalent bonds between
carbon atoms; for example, alkenes and alkynes

valence: the charge on an ion 

valence electrons: those electrons that occupy the highest shell
of an atom and are used by the atom to form chemical bonds
(theoretical definition)

van der Waals forces: weak intermolecular attractions,
including London dispersion forces and dipole–dipole forces

weak acid: an acid with characteristic properties less than those
of a strong acid (empirical definition); an acid that ionizes only
partially (<50%) in water to form hydrogen ions, so exists pri-
marily in the form of molecules (theoretical definition)

weak base: a chemical that reacts less than 50% with water to
produce hydroxide ions (according to the “reaction-with-
water” theory)

word equation: a representation of a chemical reaction using
only the names of the chemicals involved

yield: the amount of product that is obtained in a chemical
reaction
