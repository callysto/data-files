Through implementation of the StellarStation hardware unit, satellite operators can share their antennas through a cloud-based platform during otherwise idle time, allowing increased transmission at much lower cost, while also passing on revenue to antenna owners in the network.

Lowering costs and increasing access will lower barriers for new businesses entering the satellite industry, as well as solve two major problems for existing satellite operators: namely, (1) insufficient satellite access time and (2) unused antenna idle time. The process is simple: Users can share their antenna’s idling time and receive credits, then use those credits to access other antennas around the globe.

Quadcopters excel with their simplicity but are highly inefficient in cruise flight. Transition aircraft can fly three times faster and ten times further with an equally sized battery, but system complexity is usually much higher.

So, the goal was set: defining a transition aircraft concept with better performance in safety, noise, speed, range and payload than existing concepts, while cutting complexity to one third.

We are a world-leading multi-disciplinary science organisation, and our goal is to deliver economic, societal, scientific and international benefits to the UK and its people – and more broadly to the world. Our strength comes from our distinct but interrelated functions:

Universities: we support university-based research, innovation and skills development in astronomy, particle physics, nuclear physics, and space science
Scientific Facilities: we provide access to world-leading, large-scale facilities across a range of physical and life sciences, enabling research, innovation and skills training in these areas
National Campuses: we work with partners to build National Science and Innovation Campuses based around our National Laboratories to promote academic and industrial collaboration and translation of our research to market through direct interaction with industry
Inspiring and Involving: we help ensure a future pipeline of skilled and enthusiastic young people by using the excitement of our sciences to encourage wider take-up of STEM subjects in school and future life (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)
We support an academic community of around 1,700 in particle physics, nuclear physics, and astronomy including space science, who work at more than 50 universities and research institutes in the UK, Europe, Japan and the United States, including a rolling cohort of more than 900 PhD students.

STFC-funded universities produce physics postgraduates with outstanding high-end scientific, analytic and technical skills who on graduation enjoy almost full employment. Roughly half of our PhD students continue in research, sustaining national capability and creating the bedrock of the UK’s scientific excellence. The remainder - much valued for their numerical, problem solving and project management skills - choose equally important industrial, commercial or government careers.

Our large-scale scientific facilities in the UK and Europe are used by more than 3,500 users each year, carrying out more than 2,000 experiments and generating around 900 publications. The facilities provide a range of research techniques using neutrons, muons, lasers and x-rays, and high performance computing and complex analysis of large data sets.

They are used by scientists across a huge variety of science disciplines ranging from the physical and heritage sciences to medicine, biosciences, the environment, energy, and more. These facilities provide a massive productivity boost for UK science, as well as unique capabilities for UK industry.

Our two Campuses are based around our Rutherford Appleton Laboratory at Harwell in Oxfordshire, and our Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire – each of which offers a different cluster of technological expertise that underpins and ties together diverse research fields. 

The combination of access to world-class research facilities and scientists, office and laboratory space, business support, and an environment which encourages innovation has proven a compelling combination, attracting start-ups, SMEs and large blue chips such as IBM and Unilever.

We think our science is awesome – and we know students, teachers and parents think so too. That’s why we run an extensive Public Engagement and science communication programme, ranging from loans to schools of Moon Rocks, funding support for academics to inspire more young people, embedding public engagement in our funded grant programme, and running a series of lectures, travelling exhibitions and visits to our sites across the year.

The process gives the physicists clues about how the particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. 

The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions.

For this purpose, the necessary infrastructure consisting of a satellite integration room and a ground station for communication is being established.New mission concepts for the implementation of &#34;Active Debris Removal&#34; are designed. In particular, uncooperative targets such as tumbling rocket upper stages are considered. These are to be stabilized via the docking of a servicer and thus prepared for a controlled re-entry. The focus here lies particularly on the multibody dynamics and attitude control in space.A docking mechanism for the servicer is under development on the basis of biologically inspired materials. Mechanisms based on adhesive bionic materials which mimic the properties of gecko feet are investigated.To validate the docking mechanism, as well as navigation techniques, a test environment is set up consisting of an air-bearing table, a robotic arm and several testing bodies (simulated experimental satellites). It is noteworthy that the experimental satellites do not require separate supply of compressed gas and thus long-term simulations are possible. </p><div><br/></div><div><a href=""http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/ag-new-systems-and-technology""><b><b></b></b></a><b><b><a href=""http://space-systems.eu/index.php/en/science/spaceflight-technology"">W</a><a href=""https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/workgroup.html"">orkgroup</a></b> New Systems and Technology</b> </div><div>The workgroup „New Systems and Technologies” studies manned and unmanned exploration of space beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

5e21ab74a9d9a32cbe12bd14,5e21aba4a9d9a32cbe12bd16,"The company OIP ""Optique et Instruments de Précision""​ was founded in Ghent in 1919, after World War I. During this war, Belgium experienced indeed the urgent necessity of having its own optical industry, capable of providing the Belgian Armed Forces with spare parts and optical instruments, as well as repairing optical systems, e.g. military binoculars. <br /><br />During the '20ies to '50ies OIP established an excellent reputation as a high-tech optical manufacturer, developing and manufacturing some outstanding quality optics and fine mechanics. Some examples are : lenses and objectives for military applications, high precision microscopes for medical and scientific applications, photo cameras and photocopy machines for the industry. This reputation of excellence soon crossed the borders and OIP became a world leader reknown for its high-tech and its innovative products. <br /><br />From the '60ies on OIP played a pioneering role in the emerging electro-optics technology (the combination of electronics and optics) as one of the first companies in Europe. With a personnel of about 400 people, OIP developed and manufactured some world premières such as the first ""Optical Sight""​ or Head-Up Display for fighter aircraft (NATO F-104 Starfighter) and the first Fire Control Systems for Main Battle Tanks (LEOPARD 1 in Belgium, Canada and Australia in collaboration with SABCA). <br /><br />Important investments were also realised in developing new technologies, such as fibre optics, laser technology, light intensification and holography, as well for military as for industrial applications. <br /><br />Since the '80ies OIP was granted substantial contracts for series delivery of Fire Control systems for export markets and holographic night vision goggles a.o. for the Belgian Army. OIP participated in space projects with a.o. the development of CPU (Critical Point Facility): a sophisticated opto-electronic minilab for scientific experiments in space and Proba-V: an earth-observation satellite, The Proba-V-instrument started its mission in 2013 to observe the global vegetation and is still working accurately. After the development of 2 instruments for the Exomars2016-mission OIP takes part in the search for life on Mars. And in the future the composition of the higher earth atmosphere will be studied thoroughly with the ALTIUS spectrometer. <br />",,"Westerring 21, Oudenaarde, 9700, Belgium",OIP Sensor Systems,2020-01-17T12:42:12.594Z,,,,,,true,,/profile-pic/1585573675448.png,,free,,100-250 employees,,,,,,,,2020-01-17T12:42:12.594Z,,,,,https://www.oip.be,2020-01-17T12:41:24.580Z,cj@oip.be,,0,2020-03-30T13:08:23.572Z,,,,,,,,,,,,free,,,,,,,,,

I work on new methods for remote sensing. For this I use algorithms that mirror the processes in our brain. These algorithms simulate a network consisting of simple nerve cells. The connections between these cells are continually adapted during the learning process until the artificial neural network can process raw data. At the moment, I am working on a software program that can automatically recognise buildings from a digital elevation model and model them three dimensionally.

that I have been part of a big research community from day one. I gather interdisciplinary information and have already been able to build up my own profile during my PhD.

Ever since I was seven years old, I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. I got in touch with DLR when I was still a student. I started by undertaking a student research project on the aerodynamics and aeroelasticity of sounding rockets at the Mobile Rocket Base MORABA, where I subsequently became an intern. I am now responsible for a rocket test rig, where I test transpiration cooling systems for supersonic combustion ramjets. The spacecraft themselves are fully reusable. I enjoy my work and like the family-like atmosphere at the Institute of Space Propulsion. We all get along very well and can completely rely on each other, especially in dangerous test settings.
